#ideas for the mod, in any specific order:


+ Priorities Fixes:
 - Review my list of options to determine which ones can be marked as mandatory and which as recommended.
 - "[FATAL] OpenXcom has crashed: Height of map MAPS/AULTA10.MAP too big for this mission, block is 9, expected: 4."
 - No matter how I modify the problem in the alien deployments tab, it still gives an error.
   * Continue investigating with Efren to see what's going on.
 - Organize the chaotic situation I have regarding medical articles, establish a unique nomenclature.
   * Use "medikit" consistently in str_ references, strings, and images.
 - Document everything in Pascal within the weaponFx folder.
 - Delete the sounds folder as I test the new sounds, be careful.
 - Finish configuring the remaining 5 buildings to match the new art style of the bases similar to TFTD.
   * The following buildings are pending:
     ~ Complete the large storage facility, add all props, and illuminate.
     ~ Large laboratory
     ~ Large workshop
     ~ Large hyperwave decoder
     ~ Large radar network
   * Obtain the TFTD basebits and edit them to match the new designs.
   * Enhance ufopaedia descriptions of the buildings.
     ~ Confirm that the hangar can now accommodate two aircraft.
     ~ Update the absurd radar information with coherent nautical mile ranges.
     ~ Allow buildings to be upgraded by building things on top of them.

 - Check the functionality of the xfiles spitter regarding hiding, to completely replace the silacoid.
 - Resolve the issue with the zombification of dogs (from xfiles).
 - Improve the image of xeno physiology; it's currently the one from HWP. Additionally,
   * Finalize this change to add new images with sprites of support units in the ufopedia.
 - Adjust cruiser maps to accommodate transport ships.
   * With the landing pads I already created, I would need to increase the landing zone space to 20x20.
   * Designate this area as the correct landing area.
 - Investigate how to resolve the following error:
   * [ERROR] STR_HANGAR can hold 2 crafts but has 0 craft-slots defined. Will draw all crafts in the center.
 - Thoroughly check the entire research tree; there seem to be many dead ends in important research.
   * Prioritize "UFO Components."
 - Clean up and correct all newlines (and double newlines).
   * Indent only at the beginning of the text, not at the beginning of a new paragraph.
 - Change all lines of the report sprite in the ufopedia from color 227 to 229; the brightness is too intense.
 - Review the changes made to alien species and reclassify their names accurately.
   * Pay special attention to Muton Commanders and Muton Warlords.
   * Perhaps create an extra investigation that provides reports on the weaknesses of aliens.
   * Every race should consist of these projects:
     ~ A live study discussing the behavior and characteristics of the species.
     ~ An autopsy establishing generalities and the functioning of the species.
     ~ A combat analysis showing weaknesses and exploiting qualities, giving a damage bonus. (Check Xenonauts posters entries).
 - Download CMP and ensure maps and everything else is up-to-date to prevent CTDs.
 - Create a new handob and floorob sprite in the new Kriss Vector style for the Xsmg.
 - Change the proximity grenade so that it's not unlocked initially, only appears with the motion detector.
 - Resolve the Suppressed Error for STR_SECTOPOD_ELITE_TERRORIST.
   * This unit can be recovered (in theory), but there is no corresponding 'liveAlien:' or 'civilianRecoveryType:' to recover.
   * Suppressed Error for 'mod': Both 'STR_CYDONIA_OR_BUST' and 'STR_ENDGAME' research are marked as 'unlockFinalMission: true'.
 - Error in the new "inventory" image for enemies.
   * Firstly, add remaining images of enemy inventory.
   * Review the size of the "slots" position for 2x2 units.

+ Finish Reorganizing Folders:
 - Fix all relative routes inside extrasprites.rul for this.
   * Be cautious, CHECK and modify the names of ALL sprites in "unitSprites" folders.
   * Rename all files within upedia races.
   * Rename all files within ufopaedia folder.

+ EfrenEspartano Help in Planes Changes:
 - Firefly
   * Resolve the issue with the ramp so that it doesn't deviate incorrectly (test by placing 3 tus).

+ Improvements to Xross UI Mod Relative to New Ethereals:
 - The cape shouldn't disintegrate but should drop to the floor.
 - The cape should be the actual corpse.
 - Ethereal disintegration should create a psionic scream, morale checking, and panicking enemy nearby troops.
 - Update lore to reflect this; you only recover the cape and dust until you conduct an interrogation, finding a proper specimen to study
 - change Ethereal scientific name to tetramand?.
 
#####

+Ufopedia Changes:

- Reorder every Ufopedia and create new sections.
- Rewrite all alien races Ufopedia entries.
- Provide realistic equivalents for all weapon descriptions.
- Modify Ancient Abomination autopsy to be more detailed.
- Consider creating a new interrogation project for advanced races.
- Center and align ALL WEAPONS in the Ufopedia.
- Remove articles about alien Elerium chargers from Ufopedia.
- Conduct a thorough review and correction of medal articles.
  * Correct and improve all texts.
  * Rearrange the position of the medal in the photo for symmetry.
  * Change commendation color based on the type (e.g., BLACK for posthumous).
  * Give priority to Erwin's speech (move that to the Cape Hope Battle article).
    ~ Invent a dossier section and move Erwin's information there.
- Give a cool name to alloy ammunition (due to Xenominium/xelloy change).
- Create better lore for tech ammo, something like "intelligent ammunition with hollow points, using Codex technology, a small onboard computer determines the depth and chooses the best time to detonate, causing shrapnel and severe internal injuries, GYROJET/DUMDUM?"
- Adjust the position of text in certain reports.
  * For heavy weapons platforms (lower it a bit for a better view of the drawing and separate paragraphs correctly).
- Use the extraNerdyPediaInfoType command in necessary articles.
  * Test how it works; currently set at 0, 1 summarized, and 2 complete.
- Create images for mech units on a 6x6 grid with the image made for Ufopedia.
- Invent new Elerium lore related to Sovereigns.
  * Check conversation with Efren again; basically, Sovereigns are like sheep to shear Elerium.
  * Rearrange the project to recreate Elerium, needing a live pair in the base.

#####

+Armor Changes:

- Add insignias to Efren's suits.
  * Add a symbol to the beret as well.
  * Confirm if more insignias can be added to the paperdoll based on the soldier's rank.
- Remake the FLUFF TEXT for the armors.
  * Consider renaming tiers.
  * Rename each armor individually.
  * Rename how all armor colors are referred to.
  * Focus especially on bodies and corpses.
- Improve armor sprites.
  * Create new sprites with cool visors for every pilot version.
  * Create different versions based on soldier sizes.
  * Ensure advanced versions cover ALL skin (test with a black background as I update).
  * Use the belly from female personal armor for non-muscular men.
- Add bulbs on hands, hips in the battlescape sprites of nerve armors.
- Implement a new pocket configuration.
  * Rearrange the positions of current pockets.
  * Add a new pocket where only "armor modules" can be placed.
    ~ Metal protection plates.
    ~ Communication nodes.
    ~ For aiming improvement.
- Redo basic armor pockets, returning the other pocket.
  * Perhaps remove pockets from personal armor.
  * Change the name from "shoulders" to "vest" or an equivalent meaning they put their things on the chest.
  
######

+Weapons Changes:

- Ensure all grenades have an implemented fuse type.
  * No fuse for basic grenades and other initial weapons.
  * Advanced explosives with a 3-turn timer.
  * Better balancing of ordnance.
  * This would differentiate three types of heavy explosives:
    ~ C4/Semtex as vanilla.
    ~ A lighter satchel charge without a counting fuse.
- Check that by eliminating certain shot types, weapons now have different maximum ranges.
- Create a better handob sprite for the Milkor AGL.
  * Slightly reduce the size of drum magazines.
- Increase the weight of the XX cannon.
- Create a breaching charge to perforate UFO walls and thus assault from different angles (check Xenonauts1 example).
  * First level: an explosive in the form of a tube/gas cylinder, called Bangalore, large, heavy, and not throwable.
  * Subsequent levels: lighter and easier to handle.
  * Later, some kind of torch/drill/specialized melee weapon to break walls and enter UFOs.
    ~ Give this terrain damage sub-property to the plasma sword and knife?
- Completely rebalance plasma weapons, especially weights.
- Change the Elerium grenade sprite to the classic alien and possibly enhance it (note: this might not be feasible).
- Rebalance the minigun to be "lighter" in the weapon itself but heavier overall, requiring a special ammo and battery backpack, which will be upgraded in the Xtier.
  * Use a belt box of ammo as a fixed backpack for the battery and bullets (Black Ops minigun box in X-Files).
  * Add vapor trails and reduce bullet speed.
  * Add a delay to "load the gun from the ground to the hands" as it involves "putting on the special backpack."
- Add a cylinder to the plasma handcannon to make it a heavy revolver.
- Use the Polish FB MSBS rifle as an experimental bullpup.
- Integrate functional flamethrowers from X-Files.
  * First version with tanks on the back.
  * Second version without a tank.
  * Third version with gelatinized Elerium.
    ~ Some tank-like weapon, perhaps a "Kokodrile"?
- Use onehandpenalty to define holographic swords like those in Mass Effect.
- Finalize the sprite change for melee weapons using Woofington files.
  * Green plasma almost like a Kopesh.
  * Laser like a saw with a beam.
  * Create a common alloy sword.
  * Create a progressive knife equivalent to the laser tier, cutting at the molecular level through vibrations (Evangelion).
  * Finalize lore for the Xelloy knife, simply sharper, lighter, and never rusts or wears out.
- Implement a recoil system.
  * Each consecutive shot with a weapon in the same turn generates an accuracy debuff.
    ~ Mitigated by the soldier's accuracy and strength stats.
  * This additional parameter could help in better balancing weapons (e.g., the PDW having little recoil but longer reload times).
- Finally, implement a shield system similar to Xenonauts.
  * Different levels and materials.
    ~ A simple one in dark gray.
    ~ One made of alloys.
    ~ One of hyper-heavy material.
    ~ One "holographic"/energy-based.
  * Use metalhit.ogg as the sound.
- Confirm the issue with the bullet sprite of the pistol taser.

+Doggos Changes:

- Create more sprites for dog paper dolls.
  * Introduce more species?
  * Provide a wide variety of fur patterns for different species.
    ~ At least 20 different sprites for each.
    ~ Rottweilers and Dobermans could be additional species, considering they don't have much variety in fur patterns.
- Develop technology to uplift dogs to sapience.
  * Utilize a soldier transformation.
  * They would gain intelligence improvements and access to more abilities.
  * The lore should explain all ethical and moral implications.
- Modify dog armor.
  * No pockets initially; perhaps add pockets to advanced versions to serve as mini-inventories.
  * Restore the strength stat.
  * Balance the stat with the weight of the armors to prevent exploits like pack mules.
- Modify dog armor sprites.
  * Basic ones will be a simple harness/plate.
  * XOps (tier 2) will be armor similar to Rylei Cod (done).
  * At the 3rd level, it would resemble Astra Militarum Canid Unit.
  * 4th level exoskeleton similar to Cod Advanced Warfare.
  * 5th level mechanical exosuit (would it require uplift to use?).
    ~ Could equip weapons like Zoid ligers, medkits?
    ~ Turn dogs into better support units.
    ~ Turn dogs into the equivalent of a "terror unit" for humans.
- Create battle sprites, currently beyond my abilities; seek assistance.
- Slow down the walking animation speed of dogs to ensure all frames are activated.

+Vehicles Changes:
- Remove the weapon slot from the dragonfly
- Replace the Knight (Interceptor 1) with the firaxis Raven's appearance from the base game.
  * Create new lore.
  * Use the obtained photo as a ufopaedia background.
  * Recolorize the basebits to a nicer color, not so dark gray.
- Replace the ROOK ufopaedia image with one xenonauts (x59 marauder)
  * change the color of the image from a reddish hue, into a more fitting blueish/gray Xelloy color.  
- Change the full name, lore, and description of the SR-71 to something cooler.
  * Change the nickname from Blackbird to something better.
- Add a drone helicopter-like sound for the Shuriken.
- Attempt to resolve the issue that drones can no longer carry things.
- Resolve HWP sprite using the Coelacanth spritesheet to have a movable wheel and turret.
  * Alternatively, check the X-Files Outrunner and confirm how its wheels move.
    ~ Confirmed to use drawing routine number 5 (sectopods).
- Use the flying tank sprite from Xenonauts to replace human Cyberdiscs.
  * They would have MRSLs as a secondary weapon.
    ~ They would behave with a lobbed effect (using "arcingShot true"), perfect for carpet bombing.
- For basic drones, use the drawing routine sprites of medusas to create an effect of going up and down at least one pixel when idle.
- Maintain the blades of the Shuriken, add a portion of central blades to the Longbow.
  * Completely redesign the Longbow sprite.
- Use Xenonauts' drones and large drones as upgrades and improvements to classic drones.
  * Require research on the anti-gravity core, equivalent to Skystrike armors in terms of research.
  
+Aliens Changes:

- Improve all missing inventory sprites for aliens significantly.
- Change Carcharodons sprites to gray.
  * Only leaders should be gray, or a darker shade of gray?
- Modify Berserker to have built-in weapons instead of basic daggers.
  * Create handobs for double daggers like those of Wolverine/Shredder/Predator.
- Improve Commander Sectoid sprites.
  * Add spikes like Aquatoids.
  * Make their heads shine?
  * Reconfirm with Efren the color of their gray Skyranger in the sprite for the entire race.
- Implement new lore for Sectopods.
  * Similar to Robocop/Dreadnoughts of Warhammer for COMMANDO Mutons.
    ~ Perpetuate them to an eternity of service and suffering.
- Improve the drawing routine of the Abomination.
- Resolve the situation with Silicoids.
  * Create a new companion for Formics to replace Silicoids.
  * Remove Silicoids as companions for Mutons.
  * Leave Silicoids for Mutons and pass Celatids/Spitters to Formics.
  * Mutons only with Berserkers and Formics with Spitters, completely eliminate Silicoids until a decent replacement is found.
- Add the new corpses of Celatids/Spitters to their correct updated versions.

+Sprites Changes:

- Improve the sprites of the Mindprobe (a sphere with notches, like the planet from Treasure Planet).
- Review tier by tier.
  * Identify missing handobs, floorobs, and bigobs (priority for the first two).
- Add underwear and/or T-shirts to sprites like the new ones in the US Army (keep it SFW).
- Continue finalizing improved handobs for certain items.
  * Use pistol and rifle clip handobs for the first tier.
  * Review and create handobs for all remaining items (there are many).
- Add raised quad-lenses to tier 1 soldier sprites, then add lower quad-lenses and find out if configuration is possible.
  * Inquire about making day and night sprites different for implementation in the first tier.
- Sectopod aliens are blue alloys; in contrast, human sectopods will be brown. Confirm this.
  * Blue color has already been changed; only need to create the human sectopods.
- Explore sources for improved versions of map and globe symbols.
  * Implement those from TFTD+ and Unexcom.
    ~ Use the "marker" command assigned to each aircraft.
	
+Minor Changes:
- cambiar la fotico de background de la base
  * darle prioridad al de armado de las naves por uno mejor
- Place manual promotions and automatic promotions in "recommended."
  * Consequently, do the same for "field promotions."
  * Deactivate "explosions on the first turn" permanently.
- Correctly place the new lore for Alien Alloy, now called Xenominium, Xenium Alloy short, and Xelloy in slang.
  * Consists of high-entropy alloys of known and other alien elements.
  * The real problem is not knowing the element but the proportion for the correct mix to obtain desired properties.
- Clean every .rul file from unused lines, reorder and correct all annotations.
  * "#----- topic -----#" should be the correct format.
  * Eliminate all that have an excess of dashes.
- Rename assault cannon to something 20mm flak.
- Rename tank AP cannon to 25 mm Bushmaster.
- Plane cannon 30 mm GAU-8/A Avenger.
  * Unlock after researching alien alloys or create an improved version with this.
- Rename the entirety of weapons for planes.
  * Almost done.
- Rename the tank plasma cannon.
- Rename plane's plasma cannon.
- Add filters to manufacturers to make it more granular.
- Force the custom initial base option to false.
- Place alloys and elerium at the top of the list order.
- Does the Alien Disassemble from alien entertainment give a Mind Probe?
  * If so, significantly reduce the price of the probe.
  * Increase the necessary hours.

+Major Changes:

- Implement daytime and nighttime camouflage.
  * Balance total vision and ranges.
- Tanks, UFOs, and Sectopods use pilots.
  * Create a new soldier transformation to train them; they will now be armor instead of units.
  * Training requires overcoming claustrophobia, thus requiring a minimum bravery.
    ~ All tanks will be single-seaters, but the pilot cannot exit quickly, so with permanent destruction, the pilot dies.
    ~ The lore will be that once the tank is assembled, special facilities are needed to remove it and extract the pilot safely.
    ~ Create a special building to help with vehicle maintenance.
  * Integrate Sectopods with human pilots; they will be brown like in vanilla for human homogeneity.
  * When "destroyed," a "ruined chassis that can be repaired" remains.
- Change all drones to a system based on "a CPU platform that can be inserted into different chassis and with different equipment."
  * The ground drone would be a platform to which various weapons could be attached, e.g., a version with rockets, a version with a support machine gun, one with a shotgun for entry.
  * Or make it a project to change "weapons within the chassis" that requires space in the workshop and engineers.
  * Additionally, they would have different "armors."
    ~ A light chassis, many TUs but low resistance.
    ~ Reinforced, heavier and stronger but with fewer TUs.
    ~ Versions with alloys, first basic and then advanced.
  * These changes would provide much more longevity to the use of drones by XCOM.
- Add inventory sprites for civilians and a variety of civilians as well (possibly from XFILES).
- Clearly add the recommendation for the song mod.
- Implement a possible Armor chipping and degradation system.
- Check all reloading TUs for every weapon.
  * Modify reload times, balance transfer times of items from one pocket to another.
  * Make bullpups take longer to reload as a balancing method.
  * Find out how to modify weapon reload times.
  * It should be faster to draw your weapon from the holster than to reload the primary.
    ~ Use the commands tuLoad and tuUnload.
  * Include this: "you need to additionally pay the cost of moving the ammo from its current inventory slot into a hand slot! Consider that when balancing reload costs."
  * "Take into consideration that, since OXCE v6.2, the OXCE behavior is now turned off by default. It can be enabled using the extendedItemReloadCost setting."
- Rebalance the weight of all objects for more intuitive values.
  * Would a total rebalancing of the soldiers' strength be needed to maintain coherent values?
- Total change in the price of items and all projects.
  * To make the numbers more coherent, or at least, as a minimum, reduce the cost of all initial weapons to say that it is scientific notation and is actually divided by a thousand.
  
  +Long Term Changes:

- Add a new type of missions similar to EU2012, such as:
  * Landed UFO (already implemented).
  * Crashed UFO (already implemented).
  * Abductions (perhaps low-scale "terror missions" with a small number of civilians, around 5, maybe?).
  * Ships attacks (counting as abductions?, small crews of sailors, less than a dozen).
  * Bomb disposal (should be the early "terror missions," maybe one per two months, to spice mission variety).
  * Asset recovery (WIP).
  * Extraction/escort (if it's possible to code a VIP mission, this should be once/twice per month?).
  * Key recovery mission twice or thrice per year MAX (already implemented).
  * Terror sites (BIG CHUNGUS ATTACKS) on council funding members, should be giant maps, a big number of civilians (20 perhaps?) and military presence (partially implemented, should be moved at least until April or May as a sign of conflict escalation).
  * Ship line cruisers (same as above, maybe two dozen passengers?).
- Improve the pacing of missions, including:
  * Delay terror in major cities by a couple of months.
  * Definitely correct the spawning in cruise ship and boat missions (these should be the first terrors, then remote places like bases/facilities, then major cities).
  * Avoid key missions appearing in nonsensical locations (Europe, for example).
- Find out how to make dynamic global reports.
- Add lore to the previous world, North Korea nuked (paint it red?), Cape of Good Hope nuked (also red?), Haiti, and the Netherlands?, Israel?
- Create medical technologies to recover wounds for humans (create a medbay and a base with a medbay included?).
- Improve buildings so that they can be upgraded by building on top.
  * Priority to defense systems.
- Completely improve the air game, interception, patrols, etc.
- Organize and overhaul alien deployments.
- Adjust the position of the Russian peninsula above the Kuril Islands, finalize changes to the world map.
- Change all references from str_ to all items.
  * Focusing on chargers and weapons.
  * Eliminating those that do not exist and focusing them correctly on their new identity.
- Each council country must have at least 4 cities on the map.
- Later add ambient music to different maps.
- Completely improve the sound database.
  * To all weapons, different effects, explosions, etc.
- Completely improve explosion sprites (check XFILES and other mods).
  * Eliminate the cheesy effect of a skull as an explosion.
  * Create explosions of different colors according to the effect or damage caused.
  * Find out how to create an "implosion" effect that grows, then collapses and immediately expands again.
- Implement elite alien weapons.
  * Confirm functionality of sprites.
  * Add a "whistling" sound to scare.
    ~ Check conversation with Efren.
- Convert all images to PNG.
  * This way, I can establish transparent alpha correctly.

+Possible Unattainable Changes:

- Create videos like in the PS1 assets.
- Rearrange mission lists to something more coherent.
- Improve maps and aesthetics of the base.
  * Review and use TFTD tiles in the XCOM base.
    ~ At the end, I could, almost done, I would only need 7 total buildings (meaning 28 blocks, with 4 of ultra-priority for Friday).
       + Large living quarters (4 buildings >ULTRA PRIORITY, almost done).
       + Large storage facilities (4 buildings >PRIORITY).
       + Large workshop (4 buildings).
       + Large laboratory (4 buildings).
       + Large psi laboratory (4 buildings).
       + Satellite network (4 buildings).
       + Hyperwave network (4 buildings).
  * Completely improve names and descriptions (e.g., change the name to barracks and the numbers of the radars).
  * Confirm how to build on top and if it could be with a discount (up to 25% off).
  * Review the file Scang.DAT, which is the map seen on the scanner.
    ~ Confirmed that it is adjusted using the MCDView to modify which one corresponds.
    ~ As there are too many, first review the index of the vanilla base and copy and paste to have a minimum functional.
    ~ Then modify to get those that really should be appropriate.
  * Talk to Efren to get TFTD basebits.
    ~ I would have to modify practically all of them since putting them directly does not work.
- Add a "voices" system with dialogues for responses and more.
- Check Cyberpunk for references to possible weapons.
- Review the new BRUTAL AI.
- Acknowledge the one who removed the letters from Amiga Kittencon (https://mod.io/g/openxcom/m/amigapsx-font-visual-upgrade-symbols).
   * Should create a section that says "INTEGRATED MODS" and also add Daedalus FMP HQSounds.
- Check how the callsings of Vigilo Confido work (ask EfrenEspartano).
- Pedirles a oxce que los loadouts sean algo definible en un RUL para q pase de partida a partida?
