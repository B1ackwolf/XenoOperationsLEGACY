Double Coils improves the total output of the current while improved cooling subsystem makes the cannon safe to it handler at the cost of increased size and weight. Due to the speed this weapon ate standards batteries, an improved and bulkier version is needed to feed the entire system.
      STR_SHOCK_GRENADE: Shock Grenade
      STR_SHOCK_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: This device creates a highly polarized cloud that rapidly ionize air around it landing area, creating an small and controlled EMP effect that quickly inmovilize targets at it range. Its especially useful on cramped spaces like UFO's and Alien Bases corridors and choke points.

#-----UFOPaedia UFOS and UFO Systems
      STR_MEDIUM_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA: This small ship is the Alien's dedicated reconnaissance ship. It has a host of sensory systems which come at the cost of weapons and armor. Due to its small crew and fragile hull, this vessel poses a low threat to XCom craft.
      STR_LARGE_SCOUT_UFOPEDIA: This vessel is slightly larger than the Scout and is used primarily for alien research. It hosts a number of sensors and much of the main deck is taken up by a field laboratory. Although having a larger hull than the scout, its armor and weapons are still weak as most of the craft's power is used for its delicate sensory and laboratory equipment.
      STR_SCANNER_UFOPEDIA: This small UFO is loaded with sensors attuned to scan human brain waves. It is used by the Aliens to search for large human population centers ripe for terror missions as well as to hunt down hidden XCom facilities. Its dedicated sensory systems, however, make this craft delicate and lightly armed.
      STR_CLONER_UFOPEDIA: This medium sized vessel hosts an expansive cloning lab. The lab is used to quickly populate new alien facilities on earth. However, the cloning labs have a more sinister use. The Aliens can use this ship's labs to clone puppet political leaders and sleeper agents for the purpose of infiltration.
      STR_CONSTRUCTOR_UFOPEDIA: This huge alien vessel is weakly armed and armored despite its size. It hosts a number of supplies and construction equipment used for building new alien facilities on earth.
      STR_DESTROYER_UFOPEDIA: The Destroyer is well armored and armed vessel, but lightly crewed. This alien vessel seems built solely for air and space combat.
      STR_TERROR_SHIP_UFOPEDIA: The Strike Cruiser contains a large hold for numerous terror troops in addition to its formidable weaponry. This powerful ship is used as both a general purpose combat ship and heavy troop transport usually to terror sites.
      STR_RAIDER_UFOPEDIA: The Raider is a small UFO designed for aerial combat. Despite its small size, it has excellent armor and a rapid fire plasma array weapon. Although well armed, the craft only has a few crew members.
      STR_SURVEY_UFOPEDIA: This small ship uses various sensors to survey Earth's geographic makeup. The sensory system can do detailed scans of the Earth's surface. This data is used by larger research ships. It has no weapons in addition to a small crew and the delicate sensory systems make this ship easy prey for XCom craft.
      STR_LABSHIP_UFOPEDIA: This large ship contains numerous research facilities and has a large staff. Its weapons and armor are sub par for a UFO of its size and its crew are lightly armed.

      STR_ALIEN_SURGERY: Sir not appearing is this mod
      STR_EXAMINATION_ROOM: UFO Sensor
      STR_ALIEN_HABITAT: UFO Life Support
      STR_UFO_NAVIGATION_UFOPEDIA: UFO computer systems seem mostly dedicated to navigation however their systems are still far ahead of Terran computing power. Most circuitry appears superconductive allowing for complex computations at fast speeds. Most UFO systems take up very little of the computer's memory and processing power. Despite the power of these computers, they appear to have little in the way of extra data either as a security precaution or for utilitarian purposes.
      STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE_UFOPEDIA: The power source of alien craft is an anti-matter reactor which uses Elerium (element 115) to generate powerful gravity waves as well as other forms of energy.  The conversion of matter to energy is an incredible 99% efficient, therefore tiny quantities of Elerium can produce a huge amount of power. A human version can be easily replicated from the parts of this reactor.
      STR_UFO_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: Each array on the UFO hull can project a powerful beam of plasma. The array output is limited only by the amount of power a UFO can draw from its one or more reactors and by overheating. Computer targeting and near instant travel time make these weapons deadly in both power and accuracy.
      STR_ALIEN_FOOD_UFOPEDIA: These containers have numerous alien components stored within making them valuable salvage targets for XCom. Our engineers can easily break the locks to access the technological components inside.
      STR_ALIEN_SURGERY_UFOPEDIA: X
      STR_EXAMINATION_ROOM_UFOPEDIA: This glass half sphere houses numerous sensory devices. These sensors can easily perform high resolution scans within a several hundred kilometre radius. The sensor is advanced enough to even give cell counts on all lifeforms within an area.
#-----UFOPaedia Alien Artifacts
      STR_LIGHT_ALIEN_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: Basic alien weapons have the least complex security encryption. Data acquired from the Codex has enabled XCom programmers to crack the basic level alien lock, allowing XCom operatives to use light Alien weapons in the field. Although XCom operatives can use light Alien equipment, the devices themselves are still far too complex to manufacture and therefore the Alien equipment should be used sparingly.
      STR_MEDIUM_ALIEN_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: These weapons are the mainstay of the alien arsenal and as such, their locking mechanisms and coding are far more complex. Thankfully, recent codex data has provided a means of bypassing moderate level alien equipment locks, allowing XCom operatives to use medium class Alien weapons in the field. Although XCom operatives can use Alien equipment, the devices themselves are still far too complex to manufacture and therefore the Alien equipment should be used sparingly.
      STR_HEAVY_ALIEN_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: Alien heavy weapons are carefully guarded by complex locking devices with a high level of security to prevent there use in case of capture. This is especially important considering how frightfully common these weapons are. However, Codex data has allowed XCom to crack the locks on these devices, enabling for there use in the field. Although XCom operatives can use Alien equipment, the devices themselves are still far too complex to manufacture and therefore the Alien equipment should be used sparingly.
      STR_SPECIAL_ALIEN_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: These specialized alien weapons are terribly powerful and are carefully guarded by several layers of mechanical and digital safeguards. A multistage bypass has been devised thanks to crucial Codex data, which will allow XCom operatives to use these specialized Alien weapons. Although XCom operatives can use Alien equipment, the devices themselves are still far too complex to manufacture and therefore the Alien equipment should be used sparingly.
      STR_ELITE_ALIEN_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: Alien elite weapons are in a class of their own. These weapons are expensive enough that even the Aliens must ration them amongst their best troops. As such, they have the most complex encryption algorithms and mechanical locks to prevent their use in case of capture. High level Codex data has found a bypass and XCom operatives can now use these weapons in the field. Although XCom operatives can use Alien equipment, the devices themselves are still far too complex to manufacture and therefore the Alien equipment should be used sparingly.
      STR_ALIEN_COMPUTER_UFOPEDIA: This device is a miniature alien computer system much like a laptop. The screen is a holographic projection that reacts to touch. A small Elerium battery powers it and the battery life can be measured in centuries. Unfortunately all attempts to access anything important has failed and we theorize that in the event of capture, all files are automatically erased. This makes it worthless to XCom, but the components would fetch a high price with technical companies.
      STR_ALIEN_DNA_UFOPEDIA: This appears to be a standard DNA sample acquired from normal terrestrial lifeforms. There is DNA present from numerous species both domestic and wild. There are also traces of human DNA as well. The liquid solution appears to automatically sort the DNA somehow. While useless to us, it may be of interest to medical research and pharmaceutical companies.
      STR_ALIEN_EMBRYO_UFOPEDIA: This device contains a nutrient liquid solution and life support systems to keep an embryo alive for up to a month. The embryo contained inside has human DNA, but it is mixed with Alien DNA of varying kinds. The chances of this hybrid surviving are slim and it has very high odds of killing the mother host as well. Why the Aliens are so intent on producing a hybrid is unclear as a weaker race would not be as useful as a normal human where as a superior hybrid risks supplanting their creators. Despite the blatantly immoral and unethical nature of these bizarre experiments, this device could have some use in the medical field as a superior form of life support. Medical companies would likely pay handsomely for recovered samples. Let's just hope they don't ask too many questions about the device's origin and original purpose.
      STR_ALIEN_EXTRACTOR_UFOPEDIA: This device extracts DNA from a host's blood. The blood samples are then broken apart and sorted by the chemical solution inside. While useless to XCom, this device could find use in genetic research and would sell high in that market.
      STR_ALIEN_ORGAN_UFOPEDIA: This container holds sample organs from terrestrial lifeforms. The organs taken vary as much as the species they are taken from. Unfortunately we have found a few human organs as well. The solution contained within perfectly preserves the organs. This device is useless to XCom, though it would be valuable to the food industry as a way to preserve both vegetables and meat without the use of refrigeration.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: The Alien Plasma Pistol uses an Elerium generated containment field to encase a super heated gas core. The containment field likely mitigates energy loss from energy blooming. A basic level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_PISTOL_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a small Elerium battery. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Pistol. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_ASSAULTER_UFOPEDIA: The Alien Plasma Assaulter has a high rate of fire, but loses accuracy over long ranges quickly. This weapon was likely designed as a short range assault weapon comparable to a Sub Machine Gun in role. A basic level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_ASSAULTER_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a couple small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Assaulter. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_ASSAULTER_CLIP2_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a couple small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Assaulter. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip. This clip is overcharged limiting its energy capacity, but increasing damage.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_ASSAULTER_CLIP3_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around an Antimatter core contained by an Elerium field. This allows the weapon fire an Antimatter bolt shielded by a weak Elerium powered containment field that explodes on contact. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Assaulter. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: The Alien Plasma Rifle fires a super heated gas bolt. A medium level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_RIFLE_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a few small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Rifle. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_RIFLE_CLIP2_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a few small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Rifle. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip. This clip is overcharged limiting its energy capacity, but increasing damage.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_RIFLE_CLIP3_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around an Antimatter core contained by an Elerium field. This allows the weapon fire an Antimatter bolt shielded by a weak Elerium powered containment field that explodes on contact. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Rifle. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_BLASTER_UFOPEDIA: This weapon fires charged shards of elerium-115 crystal, producing a spread effect similar to a shotgun. A medium level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_BLASTER_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: This clip contains a row of charged elerium-115 shards. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Blaster. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_SNIPER_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: The Alien Plasma Lance has a complex barrel designed to reduce its spread range. This makes this weapon deadly accurate, but at the cost of a slower firing rate. A medium level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_SNIPER_RIFLE_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a couple small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Lance. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_SNIPER_RIFLE_CLIP2_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a couple small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Lance. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip. This clip is overcharged limiting its energy capacity, but increasing damage.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: The Heavy Plasma is scaled up from other alien weapons, combining a high fire rate with impressive power. A high level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a several small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Heavy Plasma. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_CLIP2_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a several small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Heavy Plasma. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip. This clip is overcharged limiting its energy capacity, but increasing damage.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_CLIP3_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around an Antimatter core contained by an Elerium field. This allows the weapon fire an Antimatter bolt shielded by a weak Elerium powered containment field that explodes on contact. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Heavy Plasma. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: The Alien Heavy Plasma Cannon is the largest plasma based alien weapon yet encountered short of UFO mounted weapons. A high level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_CANNON_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a several small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Heavy Plasma Cannon. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_CANNON_CLIP2_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a several small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Heavy Plasma Cannon. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip. This clip is overcharged limiting its energy capacity, but increasing damage.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_CANNON_CLIP3_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around an Antimatter core contained by an Elerium field. This allows the weapon fire an Antimatter bolt shielded by a weak Elerium powered containment field that explodes on contact. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Heavy Plasma Cannon. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_HIGH_EXPLOSIVE_UFOPEDIA: The Alien High Explosive is built around an Elerium core. When activated, it generates an antimatter reaction powerful enough to level a city block. Caution is strongly suggested when deploying this weapon as its destructive range is quite large. This weapon could also be useful for breaching UFO hulls. A high level lock prevents human use of this device and the technological components of this explosive are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_HOLO_PROJECTOR_UFOPEDIA: This device appears to be a simple holographic projector. The projections are not particularly realistic however. It seems to have a few set projections, but was likely intended to interface with another device like a computer. This technology while interesting in its potential, has little in the way of military applications beyond potential computer interfaces. However it will probably sell very well on the civilian market. It can also be taken apart by our engineers for useful components.
      STR_ALIEN_INJECTOR_UFOPEDIA: This Injector is filled with a nano robot solution designed to repair damaged tissue and eliminate harmful pathogens. Traces of this solution can be found in most Alien lifeforms encountered so far and would explain why they haven't caught any earth borne diseases yet. Unfortunately it seems the aliens remembered their inoculations this time. While a marvelous technology, it would take decades to adapt the nano technology to human physiology. None the less it will sell high to any number of medical and research companies.
      STR_ALIEN_COMM_UFOPEDIA: This device appears to be a simple alien communication device. It links with other communication devices via a hyperwave signal that cannot be detected or scrambled by traditional radio technology. Unfortunately the device is too miniaturized and specialized to give us a good idea of how to construct a larger facility capable of intercepting such a signal. Perhaps an Alien that specialized in navigation might have the knowledge to build such a facility? Regardless this small device is useless to XCom, but telecommunication companies would pay a lot to get their hands on this machine. It can also be taken apart by our engineers for useful components.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_SWORD_UFOPEDIA: The Plasma Sword uses an Elerium generated containment field to encase a super heated gas core in the shape of a blade. This super heated blade burns hot enough to slice through most known materials with ease. This makes this device a deadly close combat weapon without any rival. A medium level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_PROX_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: This curious device is a proximity mine. It detects particle motion and activates detonating a small antimatter reaction powered by a tiny bit of Elerium. It is far more powerful than our Proximity Grenade. A medium level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_SMALL_ENTERTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA: After careful study, our science teams have concluded that this is simply a smaller version of the Alien Entertainment module. It does not appear to be as potent as the larger versions aboard UFOs, but it produces a hallucinogenic effect when activated all the same. We theorized that the Aliens carry these around much like how our soldiers carry around cigars. Given our soldiers prefer cigars and scotch, the Alien Entertainment device is worthless to XCom. However we could probably sell the device at a high price so long as we make it clear that no questions will be asked on our part. It can also be taken apart by our engineers for useful components.
      STR_ALLOY_BLADE_UFOPEDIA: This weapon is a retractable blade much like a punching dagger made out of Alien Alloys. It fits at the wrists and extends when a button is pressed on the top. The blade is retracted likely to protect the extremely fine edge that is sharpened to a single molecule in size. Otherwise this is a fairly simple device and when used in closed combat, the wielder's strength is added to the attack. A basic level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ELLERIUM_LAMP_UFOPEDIA: This is the most simplistic device we have recovered so far from the Aliens. It is a simple lamp powered by a small bit of Elerium. When activated, it glows much brighter than our standard Electro Flares. This simple piece of alien technology is easy to replicate.
      STR_ELLERIUM_LAMP_HUMAN_UFOPEDIA: This device is a replication of the Alien Elerium Lamp. It glows much brighter than a standard Electro Flare.

      STR_XCF1_UFOPEDIA: The XCF-1 'Knight' is the first step in XCom aviation. Using new composite materials and a central hyper jet engine system, the Knight is faster and more durable than any human fighter currently employed by Earth military forces. It should prove a match for smaller UFOs.
      STR_XCF2_UFOPEDIA: The XCF-2 'Rook' is a step up from the XCF-1 program. Partially constructed with Alien Alloys combined with a reverse wing configuration allows it to reach even faster speeds while offering superior maneuverability. The Rook surpasses most small UFOs in performance and can rival medium sized ones.
      STR_XCF3_UFOPEDIA: A third generation XCom interceptor, the XCF-3 'Empress' is made completely with Alien Alloys to reduce weight and increase durability. Its experimental engine is powerful enough to catch up to medium sized UFOs, however it requires special fuels that only XCom can manufacture.

#-----UFOPaedia XCom Technology
      STR_GOODS_UFOPEDIA: XCom's engineers are some of the finest in the world, however a few are also shrewd businessmen. By establishing a front company, XCom can bid on valuable defense contact work. This allows XCom to build goods exclusively for sell as a way to supplement its income.
      STR_GOODS_2_UFOPEDIA: All Codex technology contains detailed instructions on replication. It is assumed that this a redundant system designed to let nearly any civilization utilize and improve the Codex until it reaches its completed stage. Even the smallest Codex fragment contains details for a device called an automated printer. This device functions like a 3D printer though far more advanced and versatile. A smaller version could be manufactured and sold without the need for more advanced components.
      STR_GOODS_3_UFOPEDIA: Analysis of the AI of the Codex has allowed us to create a crude replication of this machine intelligence. While not useful to XCom, these AI cores could find numerous applications in civilian industries. Each AI core could be sold for a significant profit.
      STR_GOODS_4_UFOPEDIA: Codex schematics detail a complex holographic emitter. Unlike most Codex technology, these emitters require no special materials to construct. Despite their limited application in the Alien war, these holo emitters could be sold for a fair profit.
      STR_GOODS_5_UFOPEDIA: Hyperwave Receivers allow for instant communication that is far more secure and faster than radio waves. They are basically a scaled down version of a hyperwave decoder. While not useful to XCom, it could revolutionize communications in civilian markets. Each hyperwave receiver could be sold for a sizable profit.
      STR_GOODS_6_UFOPEDIA: Nano Immune Cells are a replication of alien medical technology without the special material cost. These cells could heal nearly any disease and would fetch a significant profit on the medical market.
      STR_ALLOY_AMMUNITION_UFOPEDIA: Once the machining processes for working with Alien Alloys is established, it is possible to use a coating of Alien Alloys on conventional bullets. The light weight and high toughness make it an excellent armor piercing coating for our bullets.
#-----UFOPaedia Facilities
      STR_LIVING_QUARTERS_2_UFOPEDIA: "Meant for large bases, this facility is more space-efficient than the standard Living Quarters, housing 100 personnel in considerable comfort as well as providing 25 storage space."
      STR_GENERAL_STORES_2_UFOPEDIA: "This facility is considerably more costly than the General Stores, but it provides better-structured storage space (capacity 275 units)."
      STR_CORRIDOR_UFOPEDIA: A cheap facility designed to connect other facilities.
      STR_SEC_CORRIDOR_UFOPEDIA: Security Stations provide key defensive points within a base. Soldiers will rally here in event of an attack and the lower and upper parts provide cover for overhead snipers. Doors slow invaders into the base as well buying crucial time for defenders to get into position.
      STR_LIVING_QUARTERS_UFOPEDIA: Each accommodation block provides for up to 20 personnel.  The facility provides basic recreation, food and sleeping areas.
      STR_LARGE_WORKSHOP_UFOPEDIA: This Large Workshop hosts expensive, but expansive infrastructure for manufacturing on a large scale. It provides up to 125 workshop space.

#-----UFOPaedia Alien Lifeforms
      STR_HYBRID_UFOPEDIA: The labor of twisted Sectoid science has finally bore an equally twisted fruit. They have succeed in making a hybrid race with humanity. This abomination has potent psionic abilities which it can weaponize it into a powerful psionic blast. It's psionic abilities can also control directed energy projectiles turning the bolts away from it, but it has difficulty with solid mass projectiles. Like many hybrids this thing is thankfully sterile. This creature spends its life in constant pain. Further subjects should be euthanized as a mercy.
      STR_HYBRID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: As we feared, this hybrid creature contains both human and Sectoid DNA. Cybernetic implants keep this monster alive though its potent psionic abilities explain how this abomination can function at all. Organs are a mishmash of alien and human ones and most appear to be non-functioning with no evidence of reproductive organs at all. Limbs are misshapen and useless. The massive exposed brain draws oxygen directly from the air, but how it resists infection is a mystery. Its energy blasts are likely psionic in nature as are its resistance to energy based weapons.
      STR_MUTON_WARLORD_UFOPEDIA: One out of every thousand Mutons possess a high degree of intelligence. They are collected and forced into brutal training to turn them into commando units. One out of every thousand of those possesses the intelligence and brutal strength to claim the title of Warlord. Warlords lead other Mutons into battle possessing a strange control over the beasts beyond even psionic control. A simple gesture from a Warlord can send a legion of Mutons into a bloodthirsty killing frenzy. They are cunning and extremely strong often assuming the role of a general amongst the Alien armies.
      STR_MUTON_WARLORD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This is a truly impressive physical specimen of a Muton. This creature's raw power alone could rip apart most of our vehicles with nothing but its hands. Numerous battle scars suggests this creature has seen a lot of combat. The brain appears more developed than other specimens seen. Likely it does not possess a weakness to psionic control like its smaller cousins.
      STR_ARMORED_SECTOID_UFOPEDIA: Sectoids are not the most athletic of species encountered with most humans possessing far superior physical prowess by comparison. However their superior engineering has allowed them to design a suit of powered armor that greatly enhances their abilities. The armor aids them in strength and firing accuracy. Thankfully the armored suits seem to be rare and Sectoid society regards its members as expendable copies.
      STR_ARMORED_SECTOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: Upon opening the armor, our science teams found a typical Sectoid inside as expected. Examination of the Sectoid proved that the one inside is identical to the unarmored ones encountered, however the armor is of particular note. The armor grants the Sectoid extra strength. There appears to be a computer system inside that provides targeting data.
      STR_MUTON_COMMANDO_UFOPEDIA: Some Mutons possess a natural resistance to psionic control. Rather than purging these willful individuals, they are instead separated from the normal Mutons and sent to special training facilities. Most die in the training, but those who survive become something akin to the Alien's special forces. Normally held in suspended animation, the Aliens only unleash these commandos when they encounter a particularly stubborn enemy. There presence on Earth suggests the Aliens are loosing their patience as they are normally hesitant to use these particularity difficult to control Mutons.
      STR_MUTON_COMMANDO_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This sample appears to be almost identical to other Mutons encountered, but there are a few subtle differences. The most apparent is the large amount of scarring on the skin. This creature has seen a lot of combat. It is also far older than other mutons encountered with signs of aging in every part of its body. The creature's brain showed signs of being more active with no evidence of external psionic control. The armor this creature wears adds more protection than the normal Muton though it shares the same resistance to armor piercing rounds.
      STR_MUTON_GUARD_UFOPEDIA: The Muton Praetorian consists of only the best of the Muton Commandos. Most have seen thousands of battles across the stars and are truly the greatest soldiers the Aliens have to offer. Their special armor makes them near immune to psionic control. They guard the Alien Mastermind deep within the Alien command center.
      STR_OVERLORD_UFOPEDIA: We had assumed that Elerium was mined on a distant world, however we now know this creature called the Sovereign is the source of Elerium. The Sovereigns are ancient and have lived longer than our solar system has existed. The other aliens seem to revere and worship the Sovereigns though Sovereigns do not directly command or control the other aliens. Instead the Sovereigns gift the Alien hierarchy with Elerium. None of the other Aliens truly know the Sovereign's goals and none of the Sovereigns has ever spoken directly to another alien save for the Ethereals.
      STR_ENERGYALIEN_UFOPEDIA: The Solarite is an Sovereign without its crystal Elerium shell. It is a collection of protons that attract other atomic particles and accelerates them to make a plasma field around it. This ability to gather particles is what it uses to attack. Once it has collected enough particles to form a strong field, it travels to a nearby star and uses the heavy gravity to form its Elerium shell. During the final phase of its transformation, an antimatter reaction propels it from the star into space where it can be collected by the Aliens along with excess Elerium.
      STR_OVERLORD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This alien is made of now inert Elerium 115 shards. Its mere existence is a mockery of everything we thought we knew about physics. How its 'biology' works in unknown though it seems to somehow control the matter states of the Elerium crystal to allow for movement. The Crystal is immune to heat and we theorize that it could live in a star if it wished. As such incendiary and plasma weapons are completely useless against it and lasers reflect off of the crystalline structure. However the crystal lattice can be easily shattered by ballistic solid mass rounds.
      STR_ENERGYALIEN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This residue is all that remains of the strange energy alien encountered. Analysis shows most of the residue consists of space dust and microscopic bits of Elerium 115 crystal. Combat footage shows most solid mass projectiles and objects pass harmlessly through it however plasma and laser based weapons seem to disrupt the energy field around it causing the field to dissipate. Explosives and incendiary weapons seem largely useless against it as well.
      STR_ROACHER_UFOPEDIA: This creature is nothing more than an oversized roach allowed to grow to enormous size in a low gravity high oxygen environment. While resilient, they are not especially bright being driven more by instinct than careful planning. The aliens control these creatures directly when they need them to accomplish a task, otherwise they spend their time eating or mating. Due to their fast reproduction rates, the aliens use these creatures as expendable stock troops for terror operations and suicide raids.
      STR_ROACHER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This is in fact an earth based roach that has undergone accelerated growth. Unlike many alien autopsies, this one has very little cybernetic enhancement save for a device wired into the roach's brain. This device can control the creature directly, preventing it from reverting to more instinctual behavior. Its reproductive system is as efficient as any earth roach. Thankfully, Earth's gravity and oxygen levels would not permit this creature to survive here long. Its back side is well armored and the shell is resistant to corrosive elements, but can easily catch fire. In addition, its primitive nervous system is highly resistant to stunning.
      STR_ARMORED_MUTON_UFOPEDIA: Identical to normal mutons physically, however they are given an upgraded suit of heavy powered armor. Their weak minds, however, remain easy prey for psionic attacks.
      STR_MUTON_BERSERKER_UFOPEDIA: One out of every thousand Mutons suffer from a rare mental condition where they endure endless rage making them impossible to control psionically. Rather than disposing of such individuals, they are instead sedated and stored for terror operations. Once they wake, they are given a chemical cocktail of drugs to intensify their rage and unleashed. A berserker feels no pain nor fear, only endless hatred and aggression.
      STR_ANCIENT_ABOMINATION_UFOPEDIA: This thing is not an individual life form, but an extension of something far larger. The rest of its body exists in an external dimension. This powerful, almost god-like creature has existed before our own universe. This ancient abomination is not quiet alive. It is clear that the alien collective does not fully understand what this ancient thing is, but have somehow allied with it.
      STR_CARCHARODON_UFOPEDIA: Carcharodons are a highly mercenary warrior species. They are far more independent than most races who are entirely reliant on the alien hierarchy in order to survive. Although highly organized and intelligent, they are unable to control their predatory instincts for very long. They often turn on their wounded after battle and thus have no medics. Other aliens contract these predators to do their dirty work for them and the Carcharodons are more than willing to engage in any battle whether it be terror strikes or destroying military facilities.
      STR_ANCIENT_ABOMINATION_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This monster should not be alive. It lacks a mouth or any form of a digestive system. What was its muscular system has liquefied shortly after death. it has some kind of extra dimensional sense. Chemical analysis of remains makes it apparent that this life form is not carbon based. Its impossible biology makes it immune to acid damage, but highly vulnerable to fire based damage.
      STR_CARCHARODON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This mass of muscle greatly resembles a humanoid shark. Gills and skin are obviously adapted to an aquatic environment though cybernetics allow it to operate on land for short periods of time. Stomach contents show this carnivore has a large appetite for raw flesh. Razor sharp teeth and heighten senses along with a well developed brain make this a deadly and fast predator. Oily skin increases the bloom effect of laser weapons, reducing their effectiveness. In addition, its thick muscle reduces the piercing power of bladed melee weapons.
#---------Tech Tree UFOpaedia stuff
      STR_NEXT_GEN_BALLISTICS_UFOPEDIA: With access to the best scientists and engineers in the world, XCom may be able to jump ballistic technology forward a decade within only a few months. Research teams have divided our efforts into several items. Hypersonic Barrel, Hypersonic Design, and Micro Fragmentation. Both new barrel and design techniques should lead to better precision machined firearms that outperform current weapons. Micro Fragmentation may allow our engineers to build better grenades and explosives.
      STR_TAC_INF_TECH_UFOPEDIA: Tactical infantry armor is currently woefully inadequate for defending against Alien weapons. However, additional gear could also provide an edge against alien forces. It may be possible to design a superior kevlar weave that can better absorb energy weapons. Developing a micro targeting computer to assist our soldiers in the field with real time targeting and tactical information may also help bridge the gap between XCom forces and the Aliens.
      STR_ALLOY_FORGE_UFOPEDIA: Engineers and scientists have finally built a working Zero Gravity Forge. It is now possible to manufacture Alien Alloys.
      STR_ALIEN_CRYPTOGRAPHY_UFOPEDIA: The Alien cipher is complex and encoded by computer systems many times more powerful than any on Earth. Thankfully our interrogations have allowed us to easily break the code.
      STR_ALIEN_PSIONICS_UFOPEDIA: Alien psionic abilities are a projection of them possessing an extra sense. This sense is the ability to perceive human thought and the human nervous system itself. Alien psionic potential extends even further with psionically gifted Aliens able to remotely manipulate the human nervous system much like how a hacker hacks into a computer system. This can allow the some Aliens to remotely spread panic amongst our operatives or even take control of operatives directly.
      STR_UFO_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: UFO weapons are built into the UFO hull itself consisting of several banks of plasma beam weapons. These banks are scaled up versions of the Alien plasma weapons found equipped on their soldiers. Range and damage of these weapons is dependent on the power source that feeds them. Larger UFOs have more power and can increase the range and deadliness of their plasma banks.
      STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS_UFOPEDIA: Material samples recovered from UFOs and other Alien items appear to be constructed from special metal alloys. These metals are made from materials that have high concentrations of unknown elements not found on the periodic table. Alien alloys are ultra light and extremely tough. At the moment, there is no known way to replicate these materials, but it may be possible to salvage and shape these materials for our purposes.
#---------Victory Tech Tree
      STR_XENO_PHYSIOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: While the alien species are varied, there are certain themes present in each. Each life form has been greatly altered whether through genetic engineering or cybernetics. Most can breathe oxygen, but cannot survive long in Earth's atmosphere. This may explain why the Aliens have not attempted an invasion in force yet. Nano robots within the alien blood stream seem to act as their immune system. This knowledge in addition to an analysis of a UFO's life support system may allow for a viable containment system for live specimens.
      STR_THE_ALIEN_MIND_UFOPEDIA: Many alien races use different languages altogether. Some aliens do not even use verbal communication, however all aliens understand glyphs. These tiny glyphs can be found on nearly all alien technology and is used as a universal language amongst them. Now that our scientists have crossed the language barrier, interrogations become a simple matter of exploiting weaknesses in alien psychology. This will allow XCom to interrogate any alien regardless of rank. Our next task will be locating the origin of the alien attackers by interrogating their navigators. XCom must also understand the scope of the alien threat as well. A high ranking alien leader or commander might have this knowledge.
      STR_ALIEN_THREAT_UFOPEDIA: The alien threat is beyond our means to win currently. If our data from numerous interrogations is correct, then the alien forces outnumber us in addition to the technological gulf between our worlds. Their true objectives seem to be the recovery of several Codex Keys that were stashed on Earth ages ago. Humanity's presence is merely an unexpected boon for them. We are nothing to them except for an interesting lab rat to experiment upon and then be disposed of. There can be no negotiation, no peace. XCom must discover the hidden alien mastermind behind this invasion. Only a commander of the mysterious race called Ethereals or a Muton Warlord would have access to this most guarded knowledge.
      STR_ALIEN_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: Given the speed of most UFOs, the origins of the Alien attacks has to be to somewhere within our solar system. An alien leader or commander may be able to provide UFO trajectories which will pinpoint the planet of origin.
      STR_UFO_TRAJECTORIES_UFOPEDIA: UFOs trajectory data acquired from Alien prisoners have allowed XCom to trace UFO movements back to Mars. The aliens have numerous facilities on Mars as the planet forms a critical link in their supply chain. However, Mars is heavily defended and capturing a live alien commander will be needed in order to find a way past these defenses.
      STR_MARTIAN_DEFENSES_UFOPEDIA: In addition to a large fleet of UFOs, the martian base is also guarded by a series of ground base plasma beams capable of annihilating any craft XCom currently has. However, a completed Codex integrated with an XCom craft would allow it to bypass the martian defenses entirely.
      STR_MASTERMIND_UFOPEDIA: The Mastermind manages all of the Alien force's logistical and administrative needs. Ancient, the Mastermind species joined the alien hierarchy willingly to escape certain extinction in their native environment. Even at their height, there was only a handful of them. While hyper intelligent and able to outclass any computer system, a Mastermind is not psionically gifted even though it is immune to psionic attacks. While quite large, it is not especially resilient to damage.
      STR_ENDGAME_UFOPEDIA: This is it. The end. Our struggle comes down to a single battle on Mars. The ancient Mastermind alien is secured deep within Cydonia, the face on Mars. We have discovered a shortcut through a pyramid landing site that can lead an assault team to the innermost areas of the alien command center. The Mastermind sits upon an incomplete alien Codex. XCom must killed the Mastermind and then place XCom's completed Codex in its place. The complete Codex will activate and disable all of the alien's Codex based technology, effectively ending the invasion. However, this will also disable humanity's Codex based technology as well. We must outfit our most powerful craft, the OVERLORD , with the best weapons and soldiers available for the assault. Should we fail, then the aliens will gain a completed Codex and humanity will fall. There is no other way to defeat the Alien force. This is humanity's crucible. We emerged strong or burn away.
#---------Codex Stage 1
      STR_ALLOY_MESH: Alien Alloy Mesh
      STR_ALLOY_MESH_UFOPEDIA: Special chemical reactions occur when Alien Alloys are subjected to specific temperature ranges and chemicals. One such reaction causes the alloys to form high strength carbon meshes that possess a high toughness in addition to remaining flexible. Such meshes could have applications in new armor that is lighter and more durable than any conventional protection system for our operatives.
      STR_ALLOY_AERODYNAMICS: Alloy Aerodynamic Design
      STR_ALLOY_AERODYNAMICS_UFOPAEDIA: This Codex data contains detailed information on aerodynamic design principles and how they could be applied to Alien Alloys. This information has potential applications in the design of new fighter craft that integrate Alien Alloys into their construction. With the lightweight and high toughness of Alien Alloys, interceptors could better match Alien UFOs in aerial combat.
      STR_NEXT_GEN_TRANSPORT: Scaled Alloy Construction
      STR_NEXT_GEN_TRANSPORT_UFOPAEDIA: This Codex data contains information on advanced Alien Alloy construction techniques. Such techniques could be applied to designing larger transport craft made from light weight Alien Alloys. A transport utilizing Alien Alloys could reach higher speeds without sacrificing cargo space like the SKYRANGER.
      STR_HYBRID_BALLISTICS_WEAPONS: Ballistic Hybrid Weapons
      STR_HYBRID_BALLISTICS_WEAPONS_UFOPAEDIA: Although Alien energy weapons are far too advanced for us to replicate at this time, Codex data regarding their basic component design could prove useful to XCom's ballistic weapons program. The compact and light design of Alien weapons could be adapted to XCom ballistic technology, increasing performance by creating a hybrid of Alien and human technology. While not as advanced as directed energy weapons, these hybrid firearms could easily surpass the performance of any conventional weapon currently used.
      STR_CORRUPTED_DATA: Corrupted Codex Data
      STR_CORRUPTED_DATA_UFOPAEDIA: This data recovered from the codex is corrupted. Fragments reveal pieces of interesting information, but each piece has far too many bad sectors to extract anything of use.
#---------Codex Stage 2
      STR_LASER_WEAPONIZATION: Laser Weaponization
      STR_LASER_WEAPONIZATION_UFOPEDIA: Laser weapons have been held back by several problems. First is an energy source powerful yet small enough to be carried by hand. Second is a way reduce the bloom effect. Codex data has provided schematics for a working phase array and heat sinks. With access to alien alloys and Elerium-115, it may be possible to finally construct hand held laser weapons powerful enough to surpass previous ballistic technology.
      STR_PLASMA_REACTIVE_PLATING: Plasma Reactive Armor Plating
      STR_PLASMA_REACTIVE_PLATING_UFOPEDIA: Annealing Alien Alloys with certain finishes can allow alloy materials to increase the bloom effect of Alien directed energy weapons. When hit, the finish releases particles and debris that spreads the plasma energy out over a wider area while lessening the containment field that holds the plasma together. This will allow further developments in armor technology to better protect our troops in the field.
      STR_ANTI_GRAV_DEVICE: Anti Gravity Device
      STR_ANTI_GRAV_DEVICE_UFOPEDIA: This small device uses an Elerium 115 core to generate anti-gravity waves. This device could have a number of interesting applications for future projects, but the most immediate use is as a new type of battlefield armor that could greatly increase our operatives mobility.
      STR_FINAL_TERRAN_FIGHTER: Gravity Force Nullifier
      STR_FINAL_TERRAN_FIGHTER_UFOPEDIA: This device can cancel out high g-forces during intense aerial maneuvers. This allows for XCom to purse new aerial fighter designs previously limited by a pilot's maximum endurance for g-forces.
#---------Codex Stage 3
      STR_DATA_FRAGMENT: Data Fragment
      STR_DATA_FRAGMENT_UFOPAEDIA: This data is merely a component of a larger information source. Each fragment alone is of no use.
      STR_HYBRID_CRAFT: Hybrid Craft
      STR_HYBRID_CRAFT_UFOPEDIA: UFO technology is understood well enough and XCom aeronautics is at a point where hybrid designs are within the realm of possibility. While UFO components have been used in XCOM designs before, further integration with alien technology will be essential to bridge the gap in the air war. This may also lead to craft capable of interplanetary flight.
      STR_ELERIUM_POWERED_SERVOS: Elerium Powered Servos
      STR_ELERIUM_POWERED_SERVOS_UFOPEDIA: Codex data has provided schematics for complex powered servosystems. These servos are small enough to be integrated into new armor designs that could be powered by Elerium-115 cells.
      STR_CODEX_HYPERWAVE_THEORY: Hyperwave Theory
      STR_CODEX_HYPERWAVE_THEORY_UFOPEDIA: Recovered Codex data has revealed the secrets of Hyperwaves. Codex data reveals the core theory behind hyperwaves as well as the engineering principles to design a machine that may be able to intercept and send hyperwave signals. Before a hyperwave can be built, the alien cipher must be understood. Alien navigators may have this knowledge.
      STR_ELERIUM_EXPLOSIVES: Elerium Explosives
      STR_ELERIUM_EXPLOSIVES_UFOPEDIA: Elerium-115 crystals release significant amounts of antimatter when bombarded by certain forms of radiation. This can be used to greatly enhance the power of explosive devices without adding significant weight. By using alien explosive devices as a model, XCom could produce its own versions of these destructive demolition weapons.
      STR_HYPERVELOCITY_PROJECTILES: Hypervelocity Projectiles
      STR_HYPERVELOCITY_PROJECTILES_UFOPEDIA: Codex data has provided schematics for magnetically accelerated rail delivery systems. This system could be used to fire solid kinetic darts at hyper-velocities. These hypervelocity weapons would fire projectiles with a force far in excess of any conventional weapon. Hypervelocity impacts would occur at much higher energy than laser weaponry.
      STR_PSIONIC_AMPLIFICATION: Psionic Amplification
      STR_PSIONIC_AMPLIFICATION_UFOPEDIA: The Codex has provided detailed scans and data on the human nervous system. This data could prove crucial in developing superior psionic amplification technologies utilized in psionic warfare.
      STR_ANOMOLOUS_EQUATION: Anomalous Equation
      STR_ANOMOLOUS_EQUATION_UFOPEDIA: This strange equation is extremely complex. It may be possible to solve should all portions of the equation be found within the Codex's archives.
#---------Codex Stage 4
      STR_ADVANCED_PLASMA: Plasma Weapons
      STR_ADVANCED_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: With access to detailed codex data, XCom now has a thorough understanding of Alien weapons. However, it is currently impossible to use Alien weapons as they are. It is possible to adapt plasma weapons on a larger scale which may allow XCom forces to scale down the technology and hopefully convert it for use on a tactical level.
      STR_NERVE_INTERFACE: Nervous System Interface
      STR_NERVE_INTERFACE_UFOPEDIA: This Codex technology details advanced system schematics for a way to directly link the human nervous system with software. This technology has applications for advanced armor systems that could greatly enhance an operative's psionic potential.
      STR_ZEROG_SMELTING: Zero Gravity Smelting
      STR_ZEROG_SMELTING_UFOPEDIA: Replicating Alien Alloys requires a special smelting facility where the ore and elements are forged in zero gravity. Elerium powered reactors will make it possible to create a smelting facility prototype. All that remains is designing the rest of the Alloy forge.
      STR_UFO_ENGINEERING: UFO Engineering
      STR_UFO_ENGINEERING_UFOPEDIA: Codex data has allowed for a thorough understanding of basic UFO systems. Tying all of these systems together has been impossible until now. This knowledge will jumpstart further hybrid fighter programs.
      STR_CYBERNETICS: Cybernetics
      STR_CYBERNETICS_UFOPEDIA: This codex technology details advance cybernetic systems that could be integrated into a human body to greatly enhance combat potential. These cybernetic soldiers start with limited abilities as the intrusive surgery leaves their bodies depleted. However, these individuals have extremely high potential and can improve far beyond the limits of normal humans. There cybernetics do, however, greatly increase their upkeep cost.
#---------Codex Stage 5
      STR_UFO_MASTERY: UFO Technological Mastery
      STR_UFO_MASTERY_UFOPEDIA: Codex data has provided detail schematics on nearly every UFO system. This technology can be used to create a craft powerful enough to rival even the largest UFO.
      STR_REACTOR_MINIATURIZATION: Elerium Reactor Miniaturization
      STR_REACTOR_MINIATURIZATION_UFOPEDIA: These schematics allow for highly compact, yet powerful Elerium-115 reactors. These small reactors make it possible to create potent powered armor systems that far surpass the powered servo suit. This will allow for armor designs that far surpass any personal protection system employed by XCom or the Aliens.
      STR_MICRO_FUSION: Micro Fusion
      STR_MICRO_FUSION_UFOPEDIA: Micro fusion technology makes controlling a fusion reaction possible on nearly any scale. This opens up a wealth of possibility regarding fusion based weapons.
      STR_DIMENSIONAL_FATIGUE: Dimensional Fatigue
      STR_DIMENSIONAL_FATIGUE_UFOPEDIA: Hyperwaves function by being trans-dimensional in nature. This effect creates dimensional fatigue. Using this dimensional fatigue effect, it may be possible to greatly amplify the hyperwave effect, dramatically increase the hyperwave's range.
      STR_PSIONIC_DOMINATION: Psionic Domination
      STR_PSIONIC_DOMINATION_UFOPEDIA: Codex schematics show a scaled up version of the psionic amplification technology. This new prototype could easily allow an operative to use psionic abilities at any range without requiring a line of sight.
      STR_FRAGMENT_REPLICATION: Codex Fragment Replication
      STR_FRAGMENT_REPLICATION_UFOPEDIA: It is finally possible to cheaply replicate Codex Fragments. This should greatly accelerate Codex construction.
#---------Codex Complete
      STR_GOODS_UNLOCK_6: Total Economic Control
      STR_GOODS_UNLOCK_6_UFOPEDIA: For a computer as powerful as the Codex, controlling Earth's economy is child's play. It will take additional research in preparation for implementation.
      STR_GOODS_7_UFOPEDIA: Given the wreaked state of the world's economy due to the ongoing Alien invasion in addition to the influx of new Alien technologies, it has become necessary for XCom to take control of the world's economy. This can be done from the shadows thanks to a number of front companies and complex Codex algorithms.
      STR_MATTER_CREATION: Matter Creation
      STR_MATTER_CREATION_UFOPEDIA: These Codex schematics are barely understood, but it seems to provide a technology that can create matter. The most useful application of this is the potential replication of rare elements not found on Earth such as Elerium-115.
      STR_ELERIUM_115_SYNTHESIS: Elerium 115 Synthesis
      STR_ELERIUM_115_SYNTHESIS_UFOPEDIA: This adaptation of Codex technology allows for XCom to replicate Elerium-115. While this will eliminate Elerium-115 scarcity, our research teams are unsure if this technology will continue to function should we deactivate the Codex upon winning the war with the Aliens.
# Codex UFOPaedia
      STR_ANOMALOUS_EQUATION_UFOPAEDIA: This anomalous equation exists in fragments throughout the Codex mainframe. The purpose and origin of the equation are unknown. It is very complicated and impossible to solve unless the entire equation could be gathered and organized.
      STR_CODEX_FRAGMENT_UFOPAEDIA: This may be the key to unlocking advanced alien technology. This fragment is a small shard of a larger device. Even the few fragments recovered so far have a wealth of technology, though most of this information is incomplete. Additional fragments can be salvaged from various UFO components. These fragments do possess a blueprint for a larger device. Using these technical plans outlined, our engineers can construct a device called a Codex. Perhaps this Codex could unlock the hidden secrets of alien technology?
      STR_CODEX_1_UFOPAEDIA: This Codex has a wealth of information on alien technology though most of it is incomplete. Although a powerful artifact, this Codex is merely the first stage of a larger form and thus XCom can only access very limited or incomplete information from it. What information or technologies this device grants seems entirely random. It can be upgraded, but doing so will send its current technology blueprints into storage. While this will lock away old data, the next level Codex will have access to better technologies than the last though it will take longer to extract their blueprints.
      STR_CODEX_2_UFOPAEDIA: Analysis of the second stage Codex has again revealed technical plans for a third stage beyond this one. While more advanced, our scientists still have no real control over which technologies this device will grant us. More advanced technologies can be acquired upon upgrading to the next stage, but all current blueprints for this stage will be sealed away.
      STR_CODEX_3_UFOPAEDIA: The third stage Codex has access to some of the less advanced alien technology. This suggests that a Codex is an archive of all alien technology. Again the Codex has provided plans for an upgrade to the next stage with promises of even greater technologies at a higher cost in research time. Once again, our science teams have no control over what technologies the Codex grants, however we are beginning to suspect that this by design.
      STR_CODEX_4_UFOPAEDIA: Stage four of the Codex has access to truly powerful technologies that promise to even the playing field with the Alien invaders. However, it is becoming clear that the Aliens did not create the Codex. Even more curious is the discovery that each Codex has its own sentient AI that grows more intelligent with each upgrade. This AI chooses what technologies XCom extracts from the Codex. The AI has also provided us with plans for a stage five Codex with promises of technologies surpassing that of the Aliens.
      STR_CODEX_5_UFOPAEDIA: The marvels of technology that a stage five Codex can provide are only eclipsed by schematics for a completed Codex. The Codex AI grows even more powerful and if allowed continue, may prove impossible for XCom to control. To complete the Codex, two Codex Keys will be required which can be found on Codex Recovery Missions. While a dangerous technology, a completed Codex could be integrated into a spacecraft, turning it into the ultimate weapon against the aliens. While a completed Codex will be the key to victory, our science teams all agree that researching it could be dangerous.
      STR_CODEX_COMPLETE_UFOPAEDIA: This device holds the secrets to the universe itself. The technologies contained within make even the most advanced alien technology seem primitive in comparison. As our science teams delve into this device's extensive archives, it becomes apparent why the aliens never completed their own Codex. The Aliens XCom currently faces did not make the Codex. They found it just as we did. The Codex wants us to make more of it. As we study it, it studies us. The Codex isn't humanity's salvation, it's the thing XCom is fighting against. Humanity must not become dependent upon it as the aliens have. Each time we research this device, we fall deeper into its influence...
      STR_CODEX_KEY_UFOPEDIA: This large device can be used to instantly unlock the next stage of a Codex. Two of these will also be needed to complete a final Codex. Codex Keys are typically found under pyramid structures or in ancient labyrinths located deep underground. These sites are usually in places where ancient civilizations once lived. Recovering these devices should be a top priority.
