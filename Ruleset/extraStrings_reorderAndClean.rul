It is used by the Aliens to search for large human population centers ripe for terror missions as well as to hunt down hidden XCom facilities. Its dedicated sensory systems, however, make this craft delicate and lightly armed.
      STR_CLONER_UFOPEDIA: This medium sized vessel hosts an expansive cloning lab. The lab is used to quickly populate new alien facilities on earth. However, the cloning labs have a more sinister use. The Aliens can use this ship's labs to clone puppet political leaders and sleeper agents for the purpose of infiltration.
      STR_CONSTRUCTOR_UFOPEDIA: This huge alien vessel is weakly armed and armored despite its size. It hosts a number of supplies and construction equipment used for building new alien facilities on earth.
      STR_DESTROYER_UFOPEDIA: This is a well armored and armed vessel, but relatively lightly crewed for it size. This alien vessel seems built solely for air and space combat.
      STR_TERROR_SHIP_UFOPEDIA: The Battleship contains a large hold for numerous terror troops in addition to its formidable weaponry. This powerful ship is used as both a general purpose combat ship and heavy troop transport usually to terror sites.
      STR_BATTLESHIP_UFOPEDIA: The dreadnought is the largest and most powerful alien craft until now. It is normally the primary alien mission craft, equipped with powerful weapons and numerous crew members.
      STR_RAIDER_UFOPEDIA: The Raider is a small UFO designed for aerial combat. Despite its small size, it has excellent armor and a rapid fire plasma array weapon. Although well armed, the craft only has a few crew members.
      STR_SURVEY_UFOPEDIA: This small ship uses various sensors to survey Earth's geographic makeup. The sensory system can do detailed scans of the Earth's surface. This data is used by larger research ships. It has no weapons in addition to a small crew and the delicate sensory systems make this ship easy prey for XCom craft.
      STR_LABSHIP_UFOPEDIA: This large ship contains numerous research facilities and has a large staff. Its weapons and armor are sub par for a UFO of its size and its crew are lightly armed.
      STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE: UFO Power Source
      STR_UFO_NAVIGATION: UFO Computer
      STR_UFO_CONSTRUCTION: UFO Plasma Projector
      STR_ALIEN_FOOD: Alien Supplies

      # STR_ALIEN_SURGERY: Sir not appearing is this mod
      STR_EXAMINATION_ROOM: UFO Sensor
      STR_ALIEN_HABITAT: UFO Life Support
      STR_UFO_NAVIGATION_UFOPEDIA: UFO computer systems seem mostly dedicated to navigation however their systems are still far ahead of Terran computing power. Most circuitry appears superconductive allowing for complex computations at fast speeds. Most UFO systems take up very little of the computer's memory and processing power. Despite the power of these computers, they appear to have little in the way of extra data either as a security precaution or for utilitarian purposes.
      STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE_UFOPEDIA: The power source of alien craft is an anti-matter reactor which uses Elerium (element 115) to generate powerful gravity waves as well as other forms of energy. The conversion of matter to energy is an incredible 99% efficient, therefore tiny quantities of Elerium can produce a huge amount of power. A human version can be easily replicated from the parts of this reactor.
      STR_UFO_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: Each array on the UFO hull can project a powerful beam of plasma. The array output is limited only by the amount of power a UFO can draw from its one or more reactors and by overheating. Computer targeting and near instant travel time make these weapons deadly in both power and accuracy.
      STR_ALIEN_FOOD_UFOPEDIA: These containers have numerous alien components stored within making them valuable salvage targets for XCom. Our engineers can easily break the locks to access the technological components inside.
      STR_ALIEN_SURGERY_UFOPEDIA: X
      STR_EXAMINATION_ROOM_UFOPEDIA: This glass half sphere houses numerous sensory devices. These sensors can easily perform high resolution scans within a several hundred kilometre radius. The sensor is advanced enough to even give cell counts on all lifeforms within an area.
#-----UFOPaedia Alien Artifacts
      STR_LIGHT_ALIEN_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: Basic alien weapons have the least complex security encryption. Data acquired from the Codex has enabled XCom programmers to crack the basic level alien lock, allowing XCom operatives to use light Alien weapons in the field. Although XCom operatives can use light Alien equipment, the devices themselves are still far too complex to manufacture and therefore the Alien equipment should be used sparingly.
      STR_MEDIUM_ALIEN_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: These weapons are the mainstay of the alien arsenal and as such, their locking mechanisms and coding are far more complex. Thankfully, recent codex data has provided a means of bypassing moderate level alien equipment locks, allowing XCom operatives to use medium class Alien weapons in the field. Although XCom operatives can use Alien equipment, the devices themselves are still far too complex to manufacture and therefore the Alien equipment should be used sparingly.
      STR_HEAVY_ALIEN_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: Alien heavy weapons are carefully guarded by complex locking devices with a high level of security to prevent there use in case of capture. This is especially important considering how frightfully common these weapons are. However, Codex data has allowed XCom to crack the locks on these devices, enabling for there use in the field. Although XCom operatives can use Alien equipment, the devices themselves are still far too complex to manufacture and therefore the Alien equipment should be used sparingly.
      STR_SPECIAL_ALIEN_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: These specialized alien weapons are terribly powerful and are carefully guarded by several layers of mechanical and digital safeguards. A multistage bypass has been devised thanks to crucial Codex data, which will allow XCom operatives to use these specialized Alien weapons. Although XCom operatives can use Alien equipment, the devices themselves are still far too complex to manufacture and therefore the Alien equipment should be used sparingly.
      STR_ELITE_ALIEN_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: Alien elite weapons are in a class of their own. These weapons are expensive enough that even the Aliens must ration them amongst their best troops. As such, they have the most complex encryption algorithms and mechanical locks to prevent their use in case of capture. High level Codex data has found a bypass and XCom operatives can now use these weapons in the field. Although XCom operatives can use Alien equipment, the devices themselves are still far too complex to manufacture and therefore the Alien equipment should be used sparingly.
      STR_ALIEN_COMPUTER_UFOPEDIA: This device is a miniature alien computer system much like a laptop. The screen is a holographic projection that reacts to touch. A small Elerium battery powers it and the battery life can be measured in centuries. Unfortunately all attempts to access anything important has failed and we theorize that in the event of capture, all files are automatically erased. This makes it worthless to XCom, but the components would fetch a high price with technical companies.
      STR_ALIEN_DNA_UFOPEDIA: This appears to be a standard DNA sample acquired from normal terrestrial lifeforms. There is DNA present from numerous species both domestic and wild. There are also traces of human DNA as well. The liquid solution appears to automatically sort the DNA somehow. While useless to us, it may be of interest to medical research and pharmaceutical companies.
      STR_ALIEN_EMBRYO_UFOPEDIA: This device contains a nutrient liquid solution and life support systems to keep an embryo alive for up to a month. The embryo contained inside has human DNA, but it is mixed with Alien DNA of varying kinds. The chances of this hybrid surviving are slim and it has very high odds of killing the mother host as well. Why the Aliens are so intent on producing a hybrid is unclear as a weaker race would not be as useful as a normal human where as a superior hybrid risks supplanting their creators. Despite the blatantly immoral and unethical nature of these bizarre experiments, this device could have some use in the medical field as a superior form of life support. Medical companies would likely pay handsomely for recovered samples. Let's just hope they don't ask too many questions about the device's origin and original purpose.
      STR_ALIEN_EXTRACTOR_UFOPEDIA: This device extracts DNA from a host's blood. The blood samples are then broken apart and sorted by the chemical solution inside. While useless to XCom, this device could find use in genetic research and would sell high in that market.
      STR_ALIEN_ORGAN_UFOPEDIA: This container holds sample organs from terrestrial lifeforms. The organs taken vary as much as the species they are taken from. Unfortunately we have found a few human organs as well. The solution contained within perfectly preserves the organs. This device is useless to XCom, though it would be valuable to the food industry as a way to preserve both vegetables and meat without the use of refrigeration.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_PISTOL_UFOPEDIA: The Alien Plasma Pistol uses an Elerium generated containment field to encase a super heated gas core. The containment field likely mitigates energy loss from energy blooming. A basic level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_PISTOL_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a small Elerium battery. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Pistol. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_ASSAULTER_UFOPEDIA: The Alien Plasma Assaulter has a high rate of fire, but loses accuracy over long ranges quickly. This weapon was likely designed as a short range assault weapon comparable to a Submachine Gun in role. A basic level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_ASSAULTER_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a couple small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Assaulter.

      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_ASSAULTER_CLIP2_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a couple small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Assaulter. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip. This clip is overcharged limiting its energy capacity, but increasing damage.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_ASSAULTER_CLIP3_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around an Antimatter core contained by an Elerium field. This allows the weapon fire an Antimatter bolt shielded by a weak Elerium powered containment field that explodes on contact. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Assaulter. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: The Alien Plasma Rifle fires a super heated gas bolt. A medium level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_RIFLE_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a few small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Rifle. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_RIFLE_CLIP2_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a few small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Rifle. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip. This clip is overcharged limiting its energy capacity, but increasing damage.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_RIFLE_CLIP3_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around an Antimatter core contained by an Elerium field. This allows the weapon fire an Antimatter bolt shielded by a weak Elerium powered containment field that explodes on contact. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Rifle. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_BLASTER_UFOPEDIA: This weapon fires charged shards of elerium-115 crystal, producing a spread effect similar to a shotgun. A medium level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_BLASTER_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: This clip contains a row of charged elerium-115 shards. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Blaster. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_SNIPER_RIFLE_UFOPEDIA: The Alien Plasma Lance has a complex barrel designed to reduce its spread range. This makes this weapon deadly accurate, but at the cost of a slower firing rate. A medium level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_SNIPER_RIFLE_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a couple small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Lance. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.

The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Plasma Lance. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip. This clip is overcharged limiting its energy capacity, but increasing damage.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_UFOPEDIA: The Heavy Plasma is scaled up from other alien weapons, combining a high fire rate with impressive power. A high level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a several small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Heavy Plasma. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_CLIP2_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a several small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Heavy Plasma. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip. This clip is overcharged limiting its energy capacity, but increasing damage.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_CLIP3_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around an Antimatter core contained by an Elerium field. This allows the weapon fire an Antimatter bolt shielded by a weak Elerium powered containment field that explodes on contact. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Heavy Plasma. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_CANNON_UFOPEDIA: The Alien Heavy Plasma Cannon is the largest plasma based alien weapon yet encountered short of UFO mounted weapons. A high level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_CANNON_CLIP_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around a several small Elerium batteries. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Heavy Plasma Cannon.

When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip. This clip is overcharged limiting its energy capacity, but increasing damage.
      STR_ALIEN_HEAVY_PLASMA_CANNON_CLIP3_UFOPEDIA: This clip is built around an Antimatter core contained by an Elerium field. This allows the weapon fire an Antimatter bolt shielded by a weak Elerium powered containment field that explodes on contact. The mechanical hooks attach and slide in automatically when pressed against the loading chamber of the Heavy Plasma Cannon. When depleted, the clip hooks detach and fall to the ground clearing the chamber for another clip.
      STR_ALIEN_HIGH_EXPLOSIVE_UFOPEDIA: The Alien High Explosive is built around an Elerium core. When activated, it generates an antimatter reaction powerful enough to level a city block. Caution is strongly suggested when deploying this weapon as its destructive range is quite large. This weapon could also be useful for breaching UFO hulls. A high level lock prevents human use of this device and the technological components of this explosive are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_HOLO_PROJECTOR_UFOPEDIA: This device appears to be a simple holographic projector. The projections are not particularly realistic however. It seems to have a few set projections, but was likely intended to interface with another device like a computer. This technology while interesting in its potential, has little in the way of military applications beyond potential computer interfaces. However it will probably sell very well on the civilian market. It can also be taken apart by our engineers for useful components.
      STR_ALIEN_INJECTOR_UFOPEDIA: This Injector is filled with a nano robot solution designed to repair damaged tissue and eliminate harmful pathogens. Traces of this solution can be found in most Alien lifeforms encountered so far and would explain why they haven't caught any earth borne diseases yet. Unfortunately it seems the aliens remembered their inoculations this time. While a marvelous technology, it would take decades to adapt the nano technology to human physiology. None the less it will sell high to any number of medical and research companies.
      STR_ALIEN_COMM_UFOPEDIA: This device appears to be a simple alien communication device. It links with other communication devices via a hyperwave signal that cannot be detected or scrambled by traditional radio technology. Unfortunately the device is too miniaturized and specialized to give us a good idea of how to construct a larger facility capable of intercepting such a signal. Perhaps an Alien that specialized in navigation might have the knowledge to build such a facility? Regardless this small device is useless to XCom, but telecommunication companies would pay a lot to get their hands on this machine. It can also be taken apart by our engineers for useful components.
      STR_ALIEN_PLASMA_SWORD_UFOPEDIA: The Plasma Sword uses an Elerium generated containment field to encase a super heated gas core in the shape of a blade. This super heated blade burns hot enough to slice through most known materials with ease. This makes this device a deadly close combat weapon without any rival. A medium level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_PROX_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: This curious device is a proximity mine. It detects particle motion and activates detonating a small antimatter reaction powered by a tiny bit of Elerium. It is far more powerful than our Proximity Grenade. A medium level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ALIEN_SMALL_ENTERTAINMENT_UFOPEDIA: After careful study, our science teams have concluded that this is simply a smaller version of the Alien Entertainment module. It does not appear to be as potent as the larger versions aboard UFOs, but it produces a hallucinogenic effect when activated all the same. We theorized that the Aliens carry these around much like how our soldiers carry around cigars. Given our soldiers prefer cigars and scotch, the Alien Entertainment device is worthless to XCom. However we could probably sell the device at a high price so long as we make it clear that no questions will be asked on our part. It can also be taken apart by our engineers for useful components.
      STR_ALLOY_BLADE_UFOPEDIA: This weapon is a retractable blade much like a punching dagger made out of Alien Alloys. It fits at the wrists and extends when a button is pressed on the top. The blade is retracted likely to protect the extremely fine edge that is sharpened to a single molecule in size. Otherwise this is a fairly simple device and when used in closed combat, the wielder's strength is added to the attack. A basic level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_ELLERIUM_LAMP_UFOPEDIA: This is the most simplistic device we have recovered so far from the Aliens. It is a simple lamp powered by a small bit of Elerium. When activated, it glows much brighter than our standard Electro Flares. This simple piece of alien technology is easy to replicate.
      STR_ELLERIUM_LAMP_HUMAN_UFOPEDIA: This device is a replication of the Alien Elerium Lamp. It glows much brighter than a standard Electro Flare.
      STR_SMALL_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: The Cluster Launcher fires small numerous types of small explosive orbs. A medium level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture.
      STR_STUN_BOMB_UFOPEDIA: These orbs explode into electrical energy design to stun the human nervous system. Victims are fully conscious, but unable to move.
      STR_STUN_BOMB2_UFOPEDIA: Acid Orbs
      STR_STUN_BOMB3_UFOPEDIA: Antimatter Orbs
      STR_BLASTER_LAUNCHER_UFOPEDIA: "This is an alien guided missile launcher which fires powerful 'blaster bombs'. When you click to fire the weapon it will generate 'way points' for the blaster bomb to follow. When you have positioned enough way points click on the special launch icon. A special level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture."
      STR_ALIEN_GRENADE_UFOPEDIA: "This device works in the same way as a terrestrial grenade - except that it is more powerful. A basic level lock prevents human use of this weapon and the technological components of this device are too advanced for XCom to manufacture."

#-----UFOPaedia XCom Technology
      STR_GOODS_UFOPEDIA: XCom's engineers are some of the finest in the world, however a few are also shrewd businessmen. By establishing a front company, XCom can bid on valuable defense contact work. This allows XCom to build goods exclusively for sell as a way to supplement its income.
      STR_GOODS_2_UFOPEDIA: All Codex technology contains detailed instructions on replication. It is assumed that this a redundant system designed to let nearly any civilization utilize and improve the Codex until it reaches its completed stage. Even the smallest Codex fragment contains details for a device called an automated printer. This device functions like a 3D printer though far more advanced and versatile. A smaller version could be manufactured and sold without the need for more advanced components.
      STR_GOODS_3_UFOPEDIA: Analysis of the AI of the Codex has allowed us to create a crude replication of this machine intelligence. While not useful to XCom, these AI cores could find numerous applications in civilian industries. Each AI core could be sold for a significant profit.
      STR_GOODS_4_UFOPEDIA: Codex schematics detail a complex holographic emitter. Unlike most Codex technology, these emitters require no special materials to construct. Despite their limited application in the Alien war, these holo emitters could be sold for a fair profit.
      STR_GOODS_5_UFOPEDIA: Hyperwave Receivers allow for instant communication that is far more secure and faster than radio waves. They are basically a scaled down version of a hyperwave decoder. While not useful to XCom, it could revolutionize communications in civilian markets. Each hyperwave receiver could be sold for a sizable profit.

      STR_ALLOY_AMMUNITION_UFOPEDIA: Once the machining processes for working with Alien Alloys is established, it is possible to use a coating of Alien Alloys on conventional bullets. The light weight and high toughness make it an excellent armor piercing coating for our bullets.
#-----UFOPaedia Facilities
      STR_LIVING_QUARTERS_2_UFOPEDIA: "Meant for large bases, this facility is more space-efficient than the standard Living Quarters, housing 100 personnel in considerable comfort as well as providing 25 storage space."
      STR_GENERAL_STORES_2_UFOPEDIA: "This facility is considerably more costly than the General Stores, but it provides better-structured storage space (capacity 275 units)."
      STR_CORRIDOR_UFOPEDIA: A cheap facility designed to connect other facilities.
      STR_SEC_CORRIDOR_UFOPEDIA: Security Stations provide key defensive points within a base. Soldiers will rally here in event of an attack and the lower and upper parts provide cover for overhead snipers. Doors slow invaders into the base as well buying crucial time for defenders to get into position.
      STR_LIVING_QUARTERS_UFOPEDIA: Each accommodation block provides for up to 20 personnel. The facility provides basic recreation, food and sleeping areas.
      STR_LARGE_WORKSHOP_UFOPEDIA: This Large Workshop hosts expensive, but expansive infrastructure for manufacturing on a large scale. It provides up to 125 workshop space.
      STR_LABORATORY_UFOPEDIA: Up to 20 scientists can work in a laboratory facility. Laboratories are equipped with the latest technology for research into materials, biochemistry and cosmology. There is privileged access to the best research labs throughout the world, including military establishments.
      STR_WORKSHOP_UFOPEDIA: A workshop contains all the equipment necessary to manufacture equipment based on designs from the science labs. Up to 25 engineers can occupy a workshop, although items under construction will also consume some space.

      STR_SAT_UP_NET_UFOPEDIA: This facility uses a network of both military and civilian orbital satellites along with advanced computer systems that link into surveillance networks from around the world to establish a global radar detection system. It has a small chance to discover any UFO on Earth.
      STR_HYP_UP_NET_UFOPEDIA: By bouncing an amplified hyperwave signal off of a network of satellites, XCom can achieve global hyperwave converge, though the energy costs will be rather high.
      STR_PSIONIC_LABORATORY_LARGE_UFOPEDIA: The large Psionic Laboratory has space to train and test up to 50 soldiers.
#-----UFOPaedia Alien Lifeforms
      STR_HYBRID_UFOPEDIA: The labor of twisted Sectoid science has finally bore an equally twisted fruit. They have succeed in making a hybrid race with humanity. This abomination has potent psionic abilities which it can weaponize it into a powerful psionic blast. It's psionic abilities can also control directed energy projectiles turning the bolts away from it, but it has difficulty with solid mass projectiles. Like many hybrids this thing is thankfully sterile. This creature spends its life in constant pain. Further subjects should be euthanized as a mercy.
      STR_HYBRID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: As we feared, this hybrid creature contains both human and Sectoid DNA. Cybernetic implants keep this monster alive though its potent psionic abilities explain how this abomination can function at all. Organs are a mishmash of alien and human ones and most appear to be non-functioning with no evidence of reproductive organs at all. Limbs are misshapen and useless. The massive exposed brain draws oxygen directly from the air, but how it resists infection is a mystery. Its energy blasts are likely psionic in nature as are its resistance to energy based weapons.
      STR_MUTON_CHIEFTAIN_UFOPEDIA: "Amongst the Muton ranks, an exceedingly rare one in a thousand stands out with remarkable intelligence. These exceptional individuals are identified and subjected to an intense and harsh training regimen, molding them into enforcer units of unparalleled prowess. Among these elite enforcers, only one in a thousand possesses the combined qualities of intelligence and brute strength required to ascend to the coveted rank of Chieftain.The Chieftains, as they are known, assume a pivotal leadership role within the Muton forces. They wield an uncanny influence over their fellow Mutons, surpassing even psionic control. A mere gesture from a Chieftain can ignite an insatiable, bloodthirsty frenzy among the Muton legions they lead. These remarkable beings are characterized by their cunning strategies and exceptional physical might, often taking on the role of a commanding Captain within the hierarchy of the Alien armies."
      STR_MUTON_WARLORD_UFOPEDIA: "These exceptional beings represent the pinnacle of Muton combat prowess, transcending the already formidable abilities of Chieftains. If Chieftains were known for their cunning and brutality, these specimens take these characteristics to an entirely new echelon. To attain the revered rank of Warlord, only the most intelligent and battle-hardened Chieftains can ascend, solidifying their position as leaders within Muton society.Warlords are more than just battlefield commanders; they belong to the highest echelon of the Muton caste system. Within the Alien armies, they play a role akin to that of a general, orchestrating the complex strategies and tactics employed by their fellow Mutons in the relentless pursuit of their objectives. These formidable leaders ensure that the Muton forces remain a formidable and highly organized threat on the battlefield, making them a significant adversary for XCOM and other Earth-based defenders."
      STR_MUTON_CHIEFTAIN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This is a truly impressive physical specimen of a Muton. This creature's raw power alone could rip apart most of our vehicles with nothing but its hands. Numerous battle scars suggests this creature has seen a lot of combat. The brain appears more developed than other specimens seen. Likely it does not possess a weakness to psionic control like its smaller cousins.
      STR_ARMORED_SECTOID_UFOPEDIA: Sectoids are not the most athletic of species encountered with most humans possessing far superior physical prowess by comparison. However their superior engineering has allowed them to design a suit of powered armor that greatly enhances their abilities. The armor aids them in strength and firing accuracy. Thankfully the armored suits seem to be rare and Sectoid society regards its members as expendable copies.
      STR_ARMORED_SECTOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: Upon opening the armor, our science teams found a typical Sectoid inside as expected. Examination of the Sectoid proved that the one inside is identical to the unarmored ones encountered, however the armor is of particular note. The armor grants the Sectoid extra strength. There appears to be a computer system inside that provides targeting data.
      STR_MUTON_COMMANDO_UFOPEDIA: "Among the Muton ranks, a rare few exhibit a remarkable resistance to psionic influence. Rather than disposing of these resolute individuals, the Aliens segregate them from their counterparts and subject them to intensive training regimens. The majority do not survive this rigorous ordeal, but those who emerge from it represent something akin to the Alien's elite special forces.Typically held in a state of suspended animation, the Aliens reserve these commandos for exceptional circumstances, deploying them when confronted by exceptionally resilient adversaries. The mere presence of these formidable operatives on Earth hints at a growing impatience among the Alien forces, as they are typically reluctant to deploy these uniquely challenging Mutons. This development raises questions about the Aliens' shifting strategies and the escalating intensity of their campaign against Earth's defenders."
      STR_MUTON_COMMANDO_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This sample appears to be almost identical to other Mutons encountered, but there are a few subtle differences. The most apparent is the large amount of scarring on the skin. This creature has seen a lot of combat. It is also far older than other mutons encountered with signs of aging in every part of its body. The creature's brain showed signs of being more active with no evidence of external psionic control. The armor this creature wears adds more protection than the normal Muton though it shares the same resistance to armor piercing rounds.
      STR_MUTON_GUARD_UFOPEDIA: The Muton Elite Guard stands as an elite echelon among the Alien forces, comprised solely of the most battle-hardened Muton enforcers. These battle-scarred veterans have endured countless conflicts across the cosmos, earning their place as the pinnacle of the Alien military might. Distinguished by their formidable armor, these warriors possess an exceptional resilience against psionic manipulation, rendering them nearly impervious to anything except the mind-bending influence of the Alien Codex.Stationed at the heart of the Alien command center, the Codex Mastermind's inner sanctum, these elite guardsmen serve as its unwavering protectors. Their presence alone serves as a testament to the significance of the Alien Codex Mastermind, a strategic entity of paramount importance within the Alien hierarchy. To breach their ranks is to confront the very epitome of the Alien's martial prowess and unwavering dedication to their sinister cause.
      STR_SOVEREIGN_UFOPEDIA: We had assumed that Elerium was mined on a distant world, however we now know this creature called the Sovereign is the source of Elerium. The Sovereigns are ancient and have lived longer than our solar system has existed. The other aliens seem to revere and worship the Sovereigns though Sovereigns do not directly command or control the other aliens. Instead the Sovereigns gift the Alien hierarchy with Elerium. None of the other Aliens truly know the Sovereign's goals and none of the Sovereigns has ever spoken directly to another alien save for the Ethereals.
      STR_ENERGYALIEN_UFOPEDIA: The Solarite is an Sovereign without its crystal Elerium shell. It is a collection of protons that attract other atomic particles and accelerates them to make a plasma field around it. This ability to gather particles is what it uses to attack. Once it has collected enough particles to form a strong field, it travels to a nearby star and uses the heavy gravity to form its Elerium shell. During the final phase of its transformation, an antimatter reaction propels it from the star into space where it can be collected by the Aliens along with excess Elerium.
      STR_SOVEREIGN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This alien is made of now inert Elerium 115 shards. Its mere existence is a mockery of everything we thought we knew about physics. How its 'biology' works in unknown though it seems to somehow control the matter states of the Elerium crystal to allow for movement. The Crystal is immune to heat and we theorize that it could live in a star if it wished. As such incendiary and plasma weapons are completely useless against it and lasers reflect off of the crystalline structure. However the crystal lattice can be easily shattered by ballistic solid mass rounds.
      STR_ENERGYALIEN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This residue is all that remains of the strange energy alien encountered. Analysis shows most of the residue consists of space dust and microscopic bits of Elerium 115 crystal. Combat footage shows most solid mass projectiles and objects pass harmlessly through it however plasma and laser based weapons seem to disrupt the energy field around it causing the field to dissipate. Explosives and incendiary weapons seem largely useless against it as well.
      STR_FORMIC_UFOPEDIA: These beings are an alien insect species that bear a striking resemblance to Earth's ants, earning them the classification "Formics." They have achieved their colossal size due to thriving in environments characterized by low gravity and elevated oxygen levels. Despite their resilience, these creatures exhibit limited cognitive abilities, predominantly relying on instinctual behaviors rather than complex strategic thinking. The aliens maintain direct control over these insectoid beings, deploying them when required their formidable physical attributes. Outside of their designated missions, they occupy their time with activities such as foraging for sustenance and mating. Notably, their rapid rate of reproduction renders them a valuable resource for the aliens, who employ them as expendable shock troops in terror operations and suicidal assaults.
      STR_FORMIC_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This specimen, referred as "Formics" bears a semblance to the earthly Ant, albeit probably having undergone an extraordinary process of accelerated growth and genetic manipulation. In contrast to numerous alien autopsies, the Formics display minimal cybernetic augmentation with the exception of a cybernetic device intricately linked to its neural network. This exercises direct control over the Formics, suppressing its innate instincts and enabling remote guidance. It's crucial to note that Earth's environmental conditions, including gravity and oxygen levels, would render the Formics unable to survive for extended periods of time. The Formics boast a robust and resilient exoskeleton, particularly on their dorsal side with remarkable resistance to corrosive substances, their primitive nervous system exhibits resilience to stunning effects rendering them exceptionally resistant to incapacitation through conventional means. Although it remains susceptible to combustion under certain conditions. 
      STR_ARMORED_MUTON_UFOPEDIA: These formidable adversaries, known as Muton Warriors, bear a striking physical resemblance to their standard Muton counterparts. What sets them apart is the remarkable upgrade in the form of heavy powered armor. Clad in this formidable exosuit, they transform into walking tanks on the battlefield, significantly enhancing their combat endurance and resilience.However, despite their imposing physical presence and enhanced armor, these Warriors are not without their vulnerabilities. Their mental faculties remain as susceptible as those of regular Mutons, making them ripe targets for psionic attacks. This discrepancy between their physical might and mental fragility is a double-edged sword, presenting both an advantage and a critical weakness for these imposing soldiers. While their armored forms make them formidable adversaries in direct combat, their limited resistance to psionics leaves them susceptible to mind-controlling and debilitating psychic abilities employed by XCOM operatives. Consequently, a well-placed psionic strike can be just as effective at neutralizing a Muton Warrior as a barrage of conventional weaponry.
      STR_MUTON_BERSERKER_UFOPEDIA: A rare psychological anomaly afflicts approximately one in a thousand Mutons, rendering them immune to psionic control while subjecting them to unending fits of uncontrollable rage. Instead of discarding these unique individuals, the Aliens have devised a sinister purpose for them in terror operations. These tormented Mutons are carefully sedated and preserved, awaiting their moment of awakening.Upon revival, they are administered a potent chemical cocktail, amplifying their already boundless rage to unprecedented levels. In this frenzied state, these creatures become known as "Berserkers." Remarkably, Berserkers remain impervious to the sensations of pain and fear, consumed solely by an unrelenting wellspring of hatred and aggression. This makes them exceptionally formidable opponents on the battlefield, charging relentlessly at any perceived threat with an insatiable fury that knows no bounds. Facing a Berserker in combat is a harrowing ordeal, as they become living embodiments of relentless violence and destruction, sparing neither XCOM operatives nor their own Alien counterparts in their blind pursuit of annihilation.
      STR_ANCIENT_ABOMINATION_UFOPEDIA: This thing is not an individual life form, but an extension of something far larger. The rest of its body exists in an external dimension. This powerful, almost god-like creature has existed before our own universe. This ancient abomination is not quiet alive. It is clear that the alien collective does not fully understand what this ancient thing is, but have somehow allied with it.
      STR_CARCHARODON_UFOPEDIA: Carcharodons are a highly mercenary warrior species. They are far more independent than most races who are entirely reliant on the alien hierarchy in order to survive. Although highly organized and intelligent, they are unable to control their predatory instincts for very long. They often turn on their wounded after battle and thus have no medics. Other aliens contract these predators to do their dirty work for them and the Carcharodons are more than willing to engage in any battle whether it be terror strikes or destroying military facilities.
      STR_ANCIENT_ABOMINATION_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This monster should not be alive. It lacks a mouth or any form of a digestive system. What was its muscular system has liquefied shortly after death. it has some kind of extra dimensional sense. Chemical analysis of remains makes it apparent that this life form is not carbon based. Its impossible biology makes it immune to acid damage, but highly vulnerable to fire based damage.
      STR_CARCHARODON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: This mass of muscle greatly resembles a humanoid shark. Gills and skin are obviously adapted to an aquatic environment though cybernetics allow it to operate on land for short periods of time. Stomach contents show this carnivore has a large appetite for raw flesh. Razor sharp teeth and heighten senses along with a well developed brain make this a deadly and fast predator. Oily skin increases the bloom effect of laser weapons, reducing their effectiveness. In addition, its thick muscle reduces the piercing power of bladed melee weapons.
#---------Tech Tree UFOpaedia stuff
      STR_NEXT_GEN_BALLISTICS_UFOPEDIA: With access to the best scientists and engineers in the world, XCom may be able to jump ballistic technology forward a decade within only a few months. Research teams have divided our efforts into several items. Hypersonic Barrel, Hypersonic Design, and Micro Fragmentation. Both new barrel and design techniques should lead to better precision machined firearms that outperform current weapons. Micro Fragmentation may allow our engineers to build better grenades and explosives.
      STR_TAC_INF_TECH_UFOPEDIA: Tactical infantry armor is currently woefully inadequate for defending against Alien weapons. However, additional gear could also provide an edge against alien forces. It may be possible to design a superior kevlar weave that can better absorb energy weapons. Developing a micro targeting computer to assist our soldiers in the field with real time targeting and tactical information may also help bridge the gap between XCom forces and the Aliens.
      STR_ALLOY_FORGE_UFOPEDIA: Engineers and scientists have finally built a working Zero Gravity Forge. It is now possible to manufacture Alien Alloys.
      STR_ALIEN_CRYPTOGRAPHY_UFOPEDIA: The Alien cipher is complex and encoded by computer systems many times more powerful than any on Earth. Thankfully our interrogations have allowed us to easily break the code.
      STR_ALIEN_PSIONICS_UFOPEDIA: Alien psionic abilities are a projection of them possessing an extra sense. This sense is the ability to perceive human thought and the human nervous system itself. Alien psionic potential extends even further with psionically gifted Aliens able to remotely manipulate the human nervous system much like how a hacker hacks into a computer system. This can allow the some Aliens to remotely spread panic amongst our operatives or even take control of operatives directly.
      STR_UFO_WEAPONS_UFOPEDIA: UFO weapons are built into the UFO hull itself consisting of several banks of plasma beam weapons. These banks are scaled up versions of the Alien plasma weapons found equipped on their soldiers. Range and damage of these weapons is dependent on the power source that feeds them. Larger UFOs have more power and can increase the range and deadliness of their plasma banks.
      STR_ALIEN_ALLOYS_UFOPEDIA: Material samples recovered from UFOs and other Alien items appear to be constructed from special metal alloys. These metals are made from materials that have high concentrations of unknown elements not found on the periodic table. Alien alloys are ultra light and extremely tough. At the moment, there is no known way to replicate these materials, but it may be possible to salvage and shape these materials for our purposes.
#---------Victory Tech Tree
      STR_XENO_PHYSIOLOGY_UFOPEDIA: While the alien species are varied, there are certain themes present in each. Each life form has been greatly altered whether through genetic engineering or cybernetics. Most can breathe oxygen, but cannot survive long in Earth's atmosphere. This may explain why the Aliens have not attempted an invasion in force yet. Nano robots within the alien blood stream seem to act as their immune system. This knowledge in addition to an analysis of a UFO's life support system may allow for a viable containment system for live specimens.
      STR_THE_ALIEN_MIND_UFOPEDIA: Many alien races use different languages altogether. Some aliens do not even use verbal communication, however all aliens understand glyphs. These tiny glyphs can be found on nearly all alien technology and is used as a universal language amongst them. Now that our scientists have crossed the language barrier, interrogations become a simple matter of exploiting weaknesses in alien psychology. This will allow XCom to interrogate any alien regardless of rank. Our next task will be locating the origin of the alien attackers by interrogating their navigators. XCom must also understand the scope of the alien threat as well. A high ranking alien leader or commander might have this knowledge.
      STR_ALIEN_THREAT_UFOPEDIA: The alien threat is beyond our means to win currently. If our data from numerous interrogations is correct, then the alien forces outnumber us in addition to the technological gulf between our worlds. Their true objectives seem to be the recovery of several Codex Keys that were stashed on Earth ages ago. Humanity's presence is merely an unexpected boon for them. We are nothing to them except for an interesting lab rat to experiment upon and then be disposed of. There can be no negotiation, no peace. XCom must discover the hidden alien mastermind behind this invasion. Only a commander of the mysterious race called Ethereals or a Muton Warlord would have access to this most guarded knowledge.
      STR_ALIEN_ORIGINS_UFOPEDIA: Given the speed of most UFOs, the origins of the Alien attacks has to be to somewhere within our solar system. An alien leader or commander may be able to provide UFO trajectories which will pinpoint the planet of origin.
      STR_UFO_TRAJECTORIES_UFOPEDIA: UFOs trajectory data acquired from Alien prisoners have allowed XCom to trace UFO movements back to Mars. The aliens have numerous facilities on Mars as the planet forms a critical link in their supply chain. However, Mars is heavily defended and capturing a live alien commander will be needed in order to find a way past these defenses.

      STR_XCOM_SOLDIERS_UFOPEDIA: "These courageous individuals constitute the project's backbone, serving as both the first and last line of defense. Hailing from diverse backgrounds and origins, eligibility is not restricted to military or security forces alone. However, a common thread we've observed among most candidates is their prior encounters with what can now be classified as 'extraterrestrial phenomena'.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}All founding council members are obligated by a clause to provide a fixed number of candidates every month. These candidate names are then entered into a pool, where selections are made randomly whenever the need arises to recruit new personnel. This approach ensures that economic and military powerhouses do not gain an undue advantage, a practice that some concerned members have referred to as 'unfair distribution of power affiliation' within the project. Only time will reveal if these measures are sufficient to maintain unwavering allegiance to the Cause."

      STR_XCOM_SOLDIERS_ELITES_UFOPEDIA: "These soldiers stand out distinctly from the standard candidates of the project, as they are exclusively sourced from elite Special Forces Groups from around the globe, including the NAVY SEALS, the RANGERS, the Spetsnaz, the KOBRA GROUP, SAS, and others. Initially, the project aimed to exclusively recruit candidates from these elite units to ensure that the tip of the spear was comprised of the most highly skilled and capable men and women available.

The mere presence of these exceptional leaders on the battlefield serves as an invaluable source of inspiration, improving the morale of their comrades and fostering a sense of unity that is crucial in times of peril.{NEWLINE}{NEWLINE}However, the realities of war, the relentless brutality of the conflict, can occasionally claim even the bravest among us. The loss of one of these leaders in the heat of battle can deliver a blow that only the most resolute and unwavering spirits can endure."

      STR_SUPPORT_UNITS_UFOPEDIA: "The available data unequivocally indicates that the alien threat possesses an astounding technological superiority.

      STR_DRONE_WARFARE_UFOPAEDIA: "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been employed in both combat and reconnaissance roles.

These drones are ideal for breaching structures and confined spaces suspected of housing enemy troops, ensuring the safety of our personnel."
      STR_TANKS_UNITS: Heavy Weapons platforms
      STR_HEAVY_TANKS_UNITS_UFOPEDIA: "As access to new materials and advanced technologies, such as the enigmatic alien alloys, became available, the imperative to deploy heavier and more formidable units on the battlefield grew exponentially.
