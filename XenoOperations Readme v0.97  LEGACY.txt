Xeno Operations v0.96 Beta
By XOps

What This Is
Xeno Operations is a large expansion mod for OpenXcom. Basically it is a bunch of stuff I wanted to see in the game. To be perfectly honest, most of this is stuff other mods have already added. There isn't much original content here save for some new alien gear and a couple of odd items here and there. A lot of graphics have been tweaked though.
How to Install
  -Make sure you have the latest nightly. This version is no longer compatible with the 1.0 milestone.
  -Copy all files to the Open XCom mods directory (where your save files are). If you can't find the mod directory, make sure you run the game once so it can create the directories.

Features
  * A ton of new weapons (easily over 50) for both XCom and the Aliens. Many weapons now have additional ammo types as well
  * Each weapon tier has a distinctive art style
  * Full marathon tech tree
  * Several new crafts, both interceptors and transports
  * New aliens
  * A new mission type on new maps
  * Cydonia mission now much more challenging
  * Several new base facilities
  * New HWPs

Highly Recommended Settings
Alien weapon self-destruction: YES. The game is balanced with this option in mind. Playing without self-destructing alien weapons will not be game breaking, but it makes it far easier and makes alien weapons far more abundant to the player which renders much of the human weapons redundant.
UFO Extender accuracy: YES. The mod does take this into account and this option greatly diversifies weapons. Playing without this option renders many of the weapons redundant.
***commendations mod by ivandogovich and shoes. IT adds tons of content to enrich your roleplay and "personality" to soldiers.

Base Mod Setting Recommendations
Any improved or defensive starting base is largely unnecessary. Xeno Ops already has a pre-built base that takes into account the changes in staff size and the new facilities
Aliens pick up weapons is unneeded. Attraction is already set for most alien items.
The Following base mods won't harm the game, but will have no effect if enabled. Best to disable these to prevent issues.
  Aliens Pick Up Weapons (Already included with Xeno Ops)
  UFOextender: Gun Melee
  UFOextender: Psionic Line of Sight (Already included with Xeno Ops)
  UFOextender: Starting Avalanches

TO THOSE WHO WISH TO USE MY GRAPHICS
I only ask that I get a mention in the credits. Modders may use whatever they wish.
  
Thanks to...
All of the OpenXcom crew for allowing me to play my favorite game again while also giving me the means to tweak it.

Anyone who gives me constructive feedback, nonconstructive feedback, tries the beta, and/or strokes my ego by telling me my mod is awesome.

A few tips
-  The Minigun is very useful for base defense since it is basically an area of effect weapon without an explosion. Park a soldier with a minigun at the end of a choke point and laugh. Otherwise it is very difficult to use and probably the worst weapon to bring to a terror site.
-  Xeno Operations armor is great for rookies. Even though it is very weak, it is a cheap armor that boosts shooting. When the rookie's stats improve, they can graduate to heavier armor.
-  It is extremely important that troops don't bunch up. The aliens have a few new area of effect weapons that are very devastating.
-  First Aid Kits are a starting medikit. They are heavy though and are more costly in TUs to use.
-  Use armor colors for quick identification of soldier roles. For example, dress all snipers in green or put the best troops in black. This allows for soldier identification at a quick glanced.
-  Security stations make base defense much easier. Updated the desing so its a little bit fairier for both sides.
-  Corridors are awesome for decreasing build times as they are a cheap facility to connect other facilities. Use them to quickly flesh out a base and then take them apart when you don't need them anymore.
-  Keep a diverse arsenal and make sure to take a wide variety of weapons with you on every mission. You never know when you might encounter an alien that is immune to certain kinds of weapons.
-  Never pass up a codex recovery mission. Ever!
-  Codex fragments can be found in nearly all UFO components.
-  Alien supplies are super useful to salvage. They have lots of a nice stuff so don't sell them.

Known Bugs
  -Clicking on the camera icon for the UAV freezes game. Right click to unfreeze game.
  -A crapton of missing UFOPaedia entries

Changelog:
v0.96.v8 LE:

  At first a small disclaimer, i have been trying the amazing BRUTAL IA MOD, and i heavily encourage to do it so to get an improved experience, i cant remark all the changes so go take a look (esto seria un link).
    -Thus as a QoL , made a small changes to metadata files so its fully compatible with BRUTAL IA MOD (in case you already tried and found XOPS LEGACY didnt showed up in the mod list for activation)
	-Finally!, after spending more time that i wished, the paperdolls layered system its fully implemented
	 *Every tier now its DONE™, there are still some clipping issues on some sprites, but they'll be progressively ironed out (nerve and personal armour doesnt cover all the body in some sprites)
      °now i can focus on finishing some sprite work like the nerve armour or updating the basic sprites to show the newer four scoped Night vision googles to name a few examples
  Finally learned how to add new nationalities:
	  *There are now 115 nationalities
      °Some flags are entirely new, others were retouched
	  °expanded the name pools of almost all countries (my target is to add at least 500 names per gender and 1000 surnames,thera still some cases were the number werent enough to consider it finished) 
	  °focused on adding missing countries with either high military spending, or history of cooperation with bigger supperpowers or UN peacekeeping forces (colombia and malasya for example)
	 *reorganized "nationalities" (i.e. the flags) into (imho) a more intiutive order, basically into alphabetical order, (so now USA and EGYPT are moved lower on the list, to name a few changes)
	  °be wary that with this changes, most of the soldiers flags will be flipped all over the place, so you might need to manually fix this yourself, sorry :s .
	-Three new doggos friends!, increasing the total to 4 diferent breeds
     *Mallinois, German Shepperds, Dobbermans and Rottweilers sprites done (if anyone has ideas for other k9 breeds that should be included tbh, im all ears)
	 *Implemented layered system on doggos, so collars and combat harness can be used the same way as armors for soldiers
	  °i will try and make new fur patters for the aviable breeds, thus having more variety
	  °all changes only in inventory screen, sadly making battlescape sprites is way above my current skills..... some day i hope.
	-Rebalanced first land drone loadout, also renamed to UCLV "DAGGER"
	  *stripped the smoke launcher (way too weak for their breaching role ) , now uses a shotgun like weapon, with very small range, but decent damage output (stick boom turns sectoids into meat confetti)
	-NEW STARTING SHIP! called the DRAGONFLY thanks a lot to efrenspartano for his gorgeos spritework, increible compadre, te la rifaste!
	 *based on the newest bell valor 280 from boeing:
	  °capacity for only twelve soldiers
	  °cant take any HWP TANKS, only dogs and small drones as auxiliary units.
	 *Should be your mainstay unit for troop transporting 
	-Old starting ship (the CUSTODIAN/dragonfly) was renamed into FIREFLY has became a new ship on their own:
     *its a crude step foward.
      °can haul 14 units, including heavy tanks
	  °intended as a "spec ops" plane, with only a pair fielded and the rest of the work done by the dragonflies(valor 280)
	  °slighty faster than before
	  °more expensive all around
	  °uses an improved battlescape map, courtesy of EFRENSPARTANO
	-Completar Now tanks are finally done (sprites are placeholder, planing to use the coelacanth sheet, so threads are animated, the same with the turret)
      *first tier  requires allien alloys for their construction (so they are light enough to be airlifted on VTOL transports)	
	  *tanks comes in two varieties for now and all use the same chassis (imported and repurporsed from XENONAUTS 1)
	   °AP (an 20mm IFV) intended for infantry support, small smoke launcher as secondary weapon .
	   °HE (classic 105mm MBT) intended for brawling aggainst heavier alien units. also with smoke launcher as backup
	-Improved sprites of tinyranks,Thanks to Filip H from the IDT group for the insights, now EVERY soldier types use a correct version:
     *Green backgrouds with yellow chevrons for basic infantry
     *Green and yellow bars for officers
	 *Blue backgrouds with yellow bars for pilots
	 *doggos has a yellow K over a red background
	-Updated some Text strings and ufopaedia entries:
	-Updated pilot suit description
	-Figthers now follow a new name convention based on chess pieces:
	 *basic f35 lore updated and renamed unto "bishop"
	 *xcf1 renamed to "Knight"
	 *xcf2 Renamed to "Rook"
	 *xcf3 renamed to "empress" based on the queen piece (queen sounded kinda bland and unispired)
	 * the ultimate ship renamed from archangel to OVERLORD based on the king piece(a more imposing and fitting name according to lore)
	 *Ufopaedia updated to some extra articles missing (hacer el de perros, el de combined arms opperations)
	  °on a related note OVERLORD ALIENS (the golden crystaline shards) are renamed to SOVEREIGN (firstly to avoid confusions of having same elements, secondly, cuz without making too much spoilers, it didnt make sense considering their position in command)
	
    -BugFixes:
	 °Declustered and streamlined some folders and files(specially names), and to make finding stuff more easier. mostly for my sanity, also in case anyone wish to use resources from the mod, remember to give credits for other people work...in the veeeeeeeeeeeery few cases where the sprites or files are entirely being made by me (like dogs sprites for example), are free to use without any issues, dont worry
	 °balanced X3 HEAVY PISTOL alloy ammunition: 50 > to 42 (it was hitting harder than a AM-Rifle )
	 °Moved the craft craft tile were all inventory items formed a pile to a safer location across ALL ships this way you'll theorethically wont lose any item by a stray rocket/grenade/cyberdisc explosion (last row of the firefly for example)
     °Fixed doggos portraits (it correctly shows the face)
	 °Updated congo flag now use the Official (since 2006) DRC 
     °okay now for real,Fixed(?) tinyranks spritesheet, last patch i changed color combinations correctly to green, they used to be RED. If anyone preffers that version, i left both files on the folder, change the names and use as your preference. 
	 °corrected the army rank description : HIGHER RANK SHOULD BE a LT. COLONEL now (instead of simply a colonel, thats reserved for pilots ranks)
	 ESTO PONERLO EN PLANES A FUTURO 
	  *advanced tier uses the hyperion from xenonauts 1. purporsely more feeble than it bigger cousin as a trade of for levitating, this is unlocked deep on the mid game tho.
	   °intended as glass cannons, they field advanced weaponry and rocket launchers as secondary weaponry
v0.96.v7 LE:
    -Added new items:
	 °All the items has custom sprites, inspired heavily from Xcomfiles. So thanks again for all the work done by solariusScorch. They need ufopaedia text which is currently being working on.
      *adrenalin syringe: gives 1 dose to revive stun soldiers (get discarded after use)
	  *First aid kit: heals 1 point of bleeding, can be used on themselves, its discarded after use),Cost more TUs,so its slower than other medkits
	  *Basic medkit:  heal 1 point of bleeding and have 5 charges, useful for dedicated medic units, its expensive,heavier but heals more quickly and recharge freely after missions.
	  *Renamed the starting medkit to Field surgeon kit: Bulkier and expensive, but more space efficient. Has access to painkillers pills and adrenaline doses, also recovers extra life points per use (mid of the road time usage).
	-Improved sprites for some weapons on early tiers:
     °the basic	PDW now resemble an IWI TAVOR (tar 21).
	 °Basic SMG now its more alike of a MP5
	 °very sliiiiight retouches to basic rifle so it looks more like a h&k 416
	 °heavy cannon got a different stock and grip, kinda look lika a milkor MGL
	 °the X6 rifle its now an heavily modded and chonkier FN SCAR-L
	 °the X4 now should resemble more a h&k UMP 9 (tried my best, might get further edits tho)
    -Added improved hand objects (made by IvanDrogovich), now a lot of items doenst use the black coconut sprite and its easier to know what your troops and carrying on a simple glimpse
	-More work done with the custom layers system:
	 °modified a lot of body sprites (groomed a lot of haircuts, to avoid clipping with some helmets and headgears)
	 °finished POWER ARMOR layers, they should correctly show the turtleneck neoprene suit and their respective hair (i would appreciate any report in case i missed anyone)
	 °finished ALLOY ARMOR (same as above)
	 °finished PERSONAL ARMOR (same as above with the addition of the googles of this tier(finally managed to get the desired "head<turtleneck<hair<googles" distribution, took me a lot of more time that i expected, sorry)
	 °sky strike should be finished soon, now that i streamlined the process
	 °with this more than half of the work should be done now (missing only nerve, and xops)
	  *Xops its being worked now, will have their googles pulled up , so it needs a bit more of work than other tiers
	  *nerve should take a bit longer as im intending of finishing all the sprite work at once (including the battlescape sprites)
	-Temporarily eliminated ALL the first chassis HWP (including basic,multi rocket, mortar, and laser) , this will be top priority for next patch.
	 °should have three basic models, expensive and should require alloy for construction (giving the land drone and doggos an early niche role),pushing back the date they are deployed one or two months .
	  *Land drone will have their smoke launcher replaced with a short range shotgun (smoke its kinda underwhealming as main weapon for it intended role imho)
	  *basic with a 20mm cannon (faster rate of fire, AP ammo), smoke launcher as secondary weapon (intended for support and scouting)
	  *a MBT with 76mm(?) HE version , a tank (cyberdisc) buster , brawler unit .
	  *a laser gatling version.
	 °Improved HWP(the cyberdisk with a tank turret welded on top)  will have their sprites replaced, secondary weapon should be either a lobbing HE or rocket launcher, main weapons should be same gatling laser and some plasma and railgun for advanced models.
	-bugfixes:
	 °manufacture items now should be more consistent
	  *biggest example: all armors showed their standard version, personal showed the "blue" version.
	 °starting date changed to january of 2024
	 °some alien missions were appearing earlier than intended (first CODEX were sectoids a whooping 60% of the time,having 4-7 cyberdisc felt quite oppresive if you got unlucky and RNG decided to put them directly aside your starting position)
	 °balanced some prices
	 °added (and removed in some occasions) items from starting base in new campaings.
	 °finally managed to fix the visual bug of rank sprites on the baseview, should work as intended
	 °last patch i said i finished tinyranks sprites, found i loaded the wrong file (SHOULD BE FINISHED NOW), (still trying to find how to add different tinysprite for different soldiertypes tho)
	 
	  
	
	 
v0.96.v6 LE:
    -Slowly but steadely restructurating some .RUL files (eliminated redundant ones, cleaning, merging and organizing others, tbh they were a mess and dear lord, i increased this mess), still a lot to do tho
	-Updated Death sounds, now all races (should) be consistent on the sound deparment, used firaxis 2012 XCOM sounds  (corrected basic mutons using new sound but more advanced versions using vainilla instead)
     °Fixed some crashes related to death sounds (thanks a lot to eleriumWard for pointing this)
	-Changed armors , finally into layers system! 
	(so many thanks to SolariusScorch, his amazing work with XFILES mod helped me a lot to understand what the hell i was doing wrong)
    (used his body sprites as basis for every edit i made to the armors sprites,to assure the maximum compatibility possible.... so hopefully , he or anyone who whises to include this armors on their mod shouldnt have bigger problems   	
	 °pilots only use blue variants
	 °other classes cant use pilot variants (gonna edit them further to make them more unique visually and conceptually)
	 °custom preview mini sprite for every armor (with the exception of skystrike and the nerve ones, this is on the to do list)
	 °First tier completely done, up to HEC armor.
	  *redone the helmets a bit ,added microphones and new night vision google system, with QUAD lenses (heavily inspired from CTO mod from EFRENSPARTANO, check it out, its pretty rad!)
	 °second tier its being worked currently, wont have any helmet until i finish retouching them.
	 °the rest of the tiers are theoretically done,their "helmets" (they use kinda astronaut thing attached to their head/neck, dont know the correct word sorry) will be finished really soon
	 SO I HUMBLY REQUEST that any rebel/floating/extra pixel i missed could be reported so i can fix them ASAP 
	-Replaced some ufopaedia images:
	 °handcrafted version for pilots (despcription still to be done)
	 °a temporal soldiers picture until i find other that satisfy me more.
	 °redone the muton commander (finally there are no more muton pajamas)
	 °an alternative F35 lighting picture
	 °an alternative XF3 fighter picture
	- made new paperdolls for DOGGOS!
     °now first two tiers use newer papperdolls, still pretty rough collored, (hope i can improve them as i learn to paint better tho)
	  *first tier a simple collar, second tier now uses a more intricated harness, with lots of straps and stuff), already drafted general ideas for next ones.
	  *plans are to integrate this with the LAYERS so instead of faces, there are others breeds (currently working on a mallinois, a doberman and a rottweiler, any ideas will be appreciated) 	
	-Replaced basic drone with a four rotors quadcopter version (added unique sound, so it buzz like commercial drones and differentiate from the rocket drone)
	-Replaced Basic sectoid sprites:
	 °Sectoids now uses a recoloured version of AQUATOIDS (my favorite alien from tftd), imho they had a more striking and unique profile, im happy with the results but currently thinking on changing the color into a more blueish gray (so the brown/kaki/coyote/ scheme is "reserved" for xcom units), kinda the palette of xcom2012 firaxis sectoids.
	 °no matter how much i tried, i wasnt satisfied with any change made to sectoids (they kept looking like a brown splat)
	-Finally changed the ranks to be more consistent:
     °every rank have an unique sprite:
	  *a single stud for rookies up to master sergeants with chevrons and stuff (also retouched background a bit)
      *retouched the pilots ranks sprites a bit and renamed them(also retouched the background into a more blueish scheme to diferentiate of standard soldiers)
	  *Officers ranks renamed and updated sprites (to avoid some misleading or confusing situations, like having a third lieutenant being promoted to a THIRD lieutenant again)
	  *ranks sprites and flags of doggos retouched a bit (so it alings better with ui and keeps the same general appearence)
	 °there is still a bug related to ranks, if you see the ranks on the base, the ui colors some parts of the studs incorrectly(easily appreciated with captains double bar for example), it works correclty in battlescape, so i guess is something related to palettes.
	-Added a new unit type, a land drone armed with a small smoke launcher, useful for scouting ahead and helping with the deployment phase, you can set up some screening before sending rookies to their (assured) death
     °eliminated mortar tank (seemed redundant, thinking on doing the same with the MRLS and repurporsed in another variant )
     °currently thinking pushing the standard tank into requiring A-Alloys to construct and delay their apparition a bit later (kinda like the laser tank on vainilla)
    -Tried adding new flags but couldnt find a way to make it work (i decided to stop making new flags, they are free to use by anyone, they took me less than 10 minutes each so if anyone is interested of making more, just DM and i would gladly help 
	- citing a very wise modder i know: Several Bugfixes done. (sorry a lot of RLI happened so i lost track of some changes made) 
	
vO.96.V5 LE:
   -Some fixes, tweaks and changes to SPRITES:
    °Taser pistol fliped (so itsnt the only weapon facing the other way around)
	°Basic heavy cannon replaced and centered (it was too mucho into a side and ended cliping in some situations)
    °compac tpistol, auto pistol , X1a pistol and x2 auto pistol got the magazines sprites reduced in size so it look compatible between each other (used the clip for the auto before, was too long compared to compact pistol for example)
    °hybrid compact and auto hybrid pistols had the same change as above. it should fits better now.
	°the basic smg and the x5 smg now has a "straighter" mag on the sprite (it shares ammo with the uzi and it looked weird having a banana curved in the main sprite yet straight mags on the pockets)
    °PDW and x5a PDW got their mags size increased (only graphically) same as above, its suposed it used 5.56 ammo yet had a tiny mag attached, it looks like a bullpup now (as intended) 
    °Pilots basic flight suit changed from moss green into a purplish blue, every tier has this purple blueish color so i thought it would be cool if this was to identify pilots.
	° Nerve Armors got their sprites slighty modified, until i retouch it further, it doesnt share the exact same sprite with personal armors (googles were changed from GREEN to PURPLE)
   -Power armors lost their ability to FLOAT (they were too op, maybe i'll add an upgraded version of the skystrike later)
   -Every armor got another tweak pass:
    °Every armor class has different pocket configurations, therefore adding an extra tradeoff for them (ex: alloy armor has increased defenses, but has around half the pockets of the personal armour, therefore the first would better be used for vanguards or frontline troopers)
	°Different atributes added in terms of vision for some armors:
	 *XOps armors has slighty better night vision
	 *personal armors has slighty better night vision and basic thermal vision (ignores smoke)
	 *alloy armors has improved night vision and basic thermals
	 *skystrike and power armors has improved night vision and advanced thermals
	 *nerve armors has PsiVision (they "sense" units even through walls)


v0.96.v4 LE:
   -correctly remplaced some wrong RUL files compressed by mistake from a very old build (sorry :C) (some tweaks to base facilities for example)
   -finally managed to make doggos unable to equip human clothing   
   -streamlined shock (stun weapons), reduced to just two ammo types (three if you count your first taser pistol into this category):
    °pistol and rifle uses the same battery (you must pick between the accuracy/reliabilty of the rifle or portability and swiftness of the pistol)
	°added missing shock weapons ufopedia entries (tried my best to translate my ideas, will prolly change later for better grammar)
	°tweaked and adjusted stats (grenade included, so theorethically everything should have their own identity and niche)
   -Hypervelocity and Laser weaponry didnt recieved this treatment (they already had a low count of weapon types, so reducing ammo even more seems redudant, small tweeaks made tho like removing auto[x3]shot of the hyper shotgun)
   -Terran Plasma tecnology recieved first streamline pass and overal tweaks:
    °compact plasma pistol,standard Pistol, heavy pistol and carbine losses the auto[x3] shoot.
    °Heavy Plasma pistol nerfed (it had outrageous damage with almost any reasonable drawbacks)
	°almost every gun in the tier toned down a bit (its suposed to be a copycat of alien plasma tecnology and its already stated its a "close but decent second place", shouldnt be THAT CLOSE (also incentivize to unlock alien weaponry)
	°standard pistol and the assaulter became the only weapons in this tier to share ammo (tried my best but in terms of balance and lore/inmmersion, any other merge would feel out of place IMHO)
*****THIS marks the end of the planning reunification and streamlining the ammunition of all weapon tiers ...at least for now until more tweaks are needed.
    -With this in mind, the general ammount of unique ammunition its reduced unto around half of the original number And (hopefully) mitigates the micro needed and puts some weapons under the spotlight
	(this specially on the first three tiers as these were the bigest culprits )
   
   

v0.96.v3 LE:
   -streamlined third tier of weapons (hybrid) and first balance sweept, changed the list orders and some strings to reflect this.
   -fixed some bugs regarding bullet sprites appearing invisible (x1 pistol for example).
   -added fixed user options critical for the balance of the mod (weapon self destruct,ufo extender accuracy).
   -added new feature for weapon reloading times (it adds the TUs needed to move the item from respective inventory slots into the weapon itself, needs a lot of testing, prolly imma increase time for specific weapons and stuff).
   -small tweaks and balance for some early weapons (minigun pellets and ammo reduced).
   -increased substantially the ammount of time you must spend to breakdown ufo components (they had only 1 hour each, you could dissasemble entire batch on less than 2 hours with a bit of micro).
   

v0.96v2 LE:
  -Streamlined first two tiers ammunition and stats;
   *As many other mods did before, the ammo system is changed so first two tiers (ballistics and improved ballistic) share magazine, both between tiers
    and between some weapons of the same tier thereby reducing (hopefully) the micro needed to operate and field a diverse collection of weapons, also (alledgedly) would give better oportunities to 
    bring some criminally underused weapons into the spotlight.
   *X Ballistic weapons had their basic ammo replaced with standard starting ammunition thus making the upgrade less of a headache and balancing a bit so the real power spike is when you start fielding
   alloy jacketed ammunition (with the respective drawback of having to spend resources for the upgrade)
   ##example: 
   °small pistol and machine pistol both uses now a 9mm magazine.
   °Their upgraded version the X1a small pistol and the X2 machine pistol uses the same 9mm magazine (from previous tier) and both uses the new 9mm alloy and 9mm tech ammunition magazine
   °The total number of ammo types needed to field(and total aviable for them) reduced from 8 to only 3
   °the same with other weapons (reducing from around 50 different ammunition to half that number aproximately)
  -Updated order list to reflect the previous change and to correct some inconsistencies
  -Updated the manufacture list to reflect the changes
  -updated ufopaedia entries to inform of this changes (still a lot of wording to do, in the pending list)
  -Fixes and minors tweaks here and there
  

v0.96v1 Legacy Extended:
  -updated to newest OXCE (7.1.4)
  -improved starting base
  -updated some XCOM BASE facilities:
  *QOL to hangars, now all objects appears inside a lateral shack instead of dispersed all around the floor
  *QOL to several buildings to have items appears on more logical spots on the second floor and in some stances on the first.
  *Improved(IMHO) and updated "security station" building, reducing the exploitative situations from the earlier desing(less unfair for the aliens)
  *added new facilities (some ufopaedia entries are pending)
  -added DOGGOS!!!! (thanks a lot to SOLARIUS SCORCH for the insights), requires an initial research project (ufopaedia pending)
  -replaced the starting desing of the skyranger (so it keeps more in tune with the current sprite art made by XOps)
  -replaced starting HWP cannon tank sprite (plan to improve this further)
  -added new soldiers types:
  *regular soldiers: acording to XCOM contract by UN, every funding country should provide recruits for the organization,countries take advantages of loopholes and that explain the wild difference on stats from soldier to soldier, they come from all kind of backgrouds)
  * Elite soldiers : the navy seals, the speznatz, the SAS and all between, in order to convice funding countries to let go their specialist, xcom must pay extra bureocratic expenses(bribing basically), thats why they cost double the price....but are almost double stats wise
  * Pilots : required to operate every ship , they are combat competent but should be used as backline troops
  * Officers: PRomoted soldiers who showed to be skilled enough to take leadership responsabilities (they must be manually chosen in the SOLDIERS tab, might improve this feature later...hopefully)
  -improved GLOBE with new countries, cities, better frontiers and terrain types (needs testing, and doble checks on balancing) (all thanks to CMP hard work to create this)
  -added new terror sites missions and types (cruisers line are back, currently needs improving, some cruiser maps lacks with a retreat zone, making it a NON RETREAT kind of mission, a total HELL if facing sectoid, needs further balance) 
  -small revision of early game weapons stats and general items:
   *tweaked some stats to better balance first two tiers of ballistic weapons
   *Increased total resistence of all objects (so you wont lose your beloved new toys to a random SMOKE grenade explosion, planning to tweak further so UPPER tiers have EVEN MORE resistance)
  -tons of other changes that i might not remember now but i know i did.....THANKS a lot to EFRENSPARTANO for all his insights and ungodly amount of patience.
  -Changed all the music and reeplaced it with the 2012 xcom (firaxis) version, THANKS TO Xover88 for his work.
V0.96
  - Updated compatibility with OXC nightly and OXCE
V0.958
  -Fixed issues with XenoOps not loading with latest nightly
  -Fixed laser sword showing up in the manufacturing at the beginning of the game

V0.954A

  -Updated Armor ruleset to implement enhanced soldier sprites
  -Update energy alien sprite to be a little better. Still not a 100% satisfied
  -Alien clips, weapons, and gear no longer scavengable. It was just too tedious to convert all of the clips into elerium cells.
  -Updated the desert tileset to look better. Well it looks better in my opinion. If you disagree, THEN YOU ARE WRONG AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD!... I mean, you can change it back by editing the Terrains ruleset.

V0.80
  -Added Skywarden transport
  -Added Heavy Hypervelocity (Was the Cannon)
  -Altered Hypervelocity Cannon graphic
  -Altered X7 LMG graphics slightly
  -Removed height, width, and length settings from map deployments since this mod doesn't mess with them anyway. Except for Cydonia of course.
  -Replaced Psi Armor with the Nerve Suit. Has new graphics and pretty much the only fanservice this mod will ever have.
  -Personal armor is back! I simply felt it was too iconic to leave out. It even has the same stats.
V0.70
  -Changed the size of a bunch of clips and other items. Found it odd that a rifle clip takes up as much space in stores as a full rifle. This should free up some space and make keeping a large stockpile of ammo less punishing for the player.
  -Added Hypervelocity weapons as a sort of final tier of weapons for XCom. Currently do Laser Damage, but I would love to change it to something else down the road (waiting for custom damage types). I will add a craft weapon sometime in the future. Note: STR_HYPERVELOCITY_WEAPONS is a holdover from when these were suppose to be the next tier of ballistic weapons. Hence why most guns have HV in front of their internal name. This was later changed to just a better conventional gun. Basically all of the internal names are mixed up. I am hesitant to fix this as changing str names is messy and it is easy to miss them.
  -Finally added Overlord alien and a terrorist unit to go with them. The sprites may be tweaked in future versions, but it will have to do for now. Original sprites are hard.
  -Changed Cursor looks because I can!
  -Satellite Uplink Center upgraded to a 2x2 facility.
  -Added Hyperwave Uplink Center upgraded to a 2x2 facility.
  -Added Large Workshop.
  -Added Large Lab.
  -Added Large Psi Lab.
  -Added Corridor. This building is super useful for building new bases.
  -Added Security Checkpoint. This building breaks base defense.
  -Changed Alloy Ammo manufacturing unlock to also require the weapon tech as well to prevent ammo types from appearing for weapons the player hasn't unlocked yet. Ditto for laser weapon ammo types as well.
  -Big change. Reworked plasma conversion system. The new system allows a player to breakdown alien equipment into useful components for building plasma weapons. Alien Plasma weapons can no longer be converted over to human weapons on a 1 to 1 ratio. This adds some much needed scarcity as well as versatility to the mod, but I worry it may end up being too tedious. If it works then I may expand the system.
  -Change Alloy Ammo research requirements to appear earlier in the tech tree. I am considering adding alloy ammo for the starting weapons as well. Not sure yet.
  -Ditto for Laser Charged Cells and Elerium Batteries.
  -Changed height of terror mission deployment to account for terrain pack compatibility.
  -Tweaked Xeno Operations Armor weight reducing it by 1
  -Changed Hybrid file names in rules to match file name in order to be case sensitive.
  -Updated UFOpedia art for Alien Origins, the Martian Solution, and Cydonia or Bust. Has some nice symbolism in it.

  -Adjusted melee animations since the frames have been reduced by a recent nightly.
  -Added melee animation for stun rod.
  -Finally added a nice little melee animation for the Reaper.
  -Stole Dioxine's large living quarters and general stores as it compliments the other facilities well.
V0.62
  -Fixed armors not showing up on the manufacturing list. Curse you search and replace! I will get you back somehow...

V0.6
  -Fixed black beret armor corpse turning green. Also fixed inventory screens.
  -Added Hybrid Terrorist Unit for Armored Sectoids.

  -Added Charged Cell ammo for all laser weapons.
  -Added Elerium batteries for all laser weapons.
  -Moved string ID of interceptor so I don't have to alter starting gear on the craft rules. It was conflicting with the starting gear for the weapons rules.

  -Fix STR issue with global radar facility not showing up in the build menu.
  -Altered Anti Material Rifle Clip weight down to four.
  -Added a small pistol, Magnum, Machine Pistol, and PDW for both starting gear and researchable XCom variants.
  -Lowered weight of Kevlar vests by 2. Might as well as the things are practically worthless as is. Shouldn't punish the player for wanting to look cool.
  -Fixed Sectoid research randomly popping up. Some junk code was causing it.
  -Changed all MAN_# to XOPS_# as well as XCOM_# to XOPS_XCOM_# to increase compatibility with other armor mods.
  -Added attack animation for the Zombie. Same as the Crysalid's though. Need to add a nice bite animation for the Reaper too.
  -Changed cyberdisc weapon bullet sprite to orange.
  -Updated UFOpedia art for both the Martian Solution and Cydonia or Bust.
