   * Subsequent levels; lighter and easier to handle.
   * Later, some kind of torch/drill/specialized melee weapon to break walls and enter UFOs??.
     ~ Give this "terrain damage" sub-property to the plasma sword and knife?
 - Ensure all grenades have an implemented fuse type.

 - Change the Elerium grenade sprite to the classic alien and possibly enhance it (note; this might not be feasible, check this later if possible).
 - Rebalance the minigun to be "lighter" in the weapon itself but heavier overall, requiring a special ammo and battery backpack, which will be upgraded in the Xtier.
   * Use a belt box of ammo as a fixed backpack for the battery and bullets (Black Ops minigun box sprite in X-Files could be used).
   * Add vapor trails and reduce bullet speed.
   * Add a delay to "load the gun from the ground to the hands" as it involves "putting on the special backpack."

 - Implement a recoil system.
   * Each consecutive shot with a weapon in the same turn generates an accuracy debuff.
     ~ Mitigated by the soldier's accuracy and strength stats.
   * This additional parameter could help in better balancing weapons (e.g., the PDW having little recoil but longer reload times).
 - Finally, implement a shield system similar to Xenonauts.
   * Different levels and materials.
     ~ A simple one in dark gray.
     ~ One made of xelloys.

     ~ Rottweilers and Dobermans could be additional species, considering they don't have much variety in fur patterns.
 - Develop technology to uplift dogs to sapience.
   * Utilize a soldier transformation.
   * They would gain intelligence improvements and access to more abilities.

 - Modify dog armor sprites.
   * Basic ones will be a simple harness.
   * XOps (tier 2) will be armor similar to Riley Cod (done).
   * At the 3rd level, it would resemble Astra Militarum Canid Unit.
   * 4th level exoskeleton similar to Cod Advanced Warfare.
   * 5th level mechanical exosuit (would it require uplift to use?).
     ~ Could equip weapons like Zoid ligers, medkits?

 - Add a drone helicopter-like sound for the Shuriken.
 - Attempt to resolve the issue that drones can no longer carry things.
 - Resolve HWP sprite using the Coelacanth spritesheet to have a movable wheel and turret.

 - Start implementing all the changes to the lore and motivations from the alien empire, including the rebranding of their faction.
   * Still on discussion but for now the term "The Accord" its the one who gained more traction, specially considering the new lore.
     ~ Perhaps add a new angle of the alien faction formed by Pro-Aliens Humans? on the same edge of EXALT/cult of sirius?
       ° If this is applied, perhaps call the organization "The Pact", following the same function MIB has in classic fiction.

   * Review and create handobs for all remaining items (there are many).
 - Add raised quad-lenses to tier 1 soldier sprites, then add lower quad-lenses and find out if configuration is possible.
   * Inquire about making day and night sprites different for implementation in the first tier.
 - Sectopod aliens are xelloy blue; in contrast, human sectopods will be brown. Confirm this.
   * Blue color has already been changed; only need to create the human sectopods.
 - hacer cambios en globemarkers

     ~ Use the "marker" command assigned to each aircraft.
 - Change background sprites for some screens on the base.
   * Background02 (soldier tab)/ Something more fitting and militarish, perhaps some soldiers formed saluting?
     ~ Inquire if there is a way to add a background specifically TO THE MEMORIAL tab, then add some kind of memorial wall, like in Firaxis or Mass Effect.
   * Background03 (terror tab)/ Create something more fitting, perhaps a city burning?
     ~ Differentiate different missions with different tabs (so all different terror types, either liners, islands, small towns, etc., have a different background).
   * Background04 (base defense)/ Something showing either soldiers fighting in a hallway (like Xenonauts vs. Androns), or some kind of missile batteries shooting at an incoming UFO.
     ~ the same file applies to base equiptment preview, some kind of armory view
   * Background13 (selling screen)/ I always liked the TFTD version of this a lot more (try to add the money suitcase too?).
   * Background14 (plane equipment)/ Im okay with the current version, might only retouch the silhouette to not be so dark, so all the changes made to plane basebits shadows stand out more.
   * Background16 (UFO related mission start)/ Some kind of POV over the shoulder inside the cockpit of our plane, flying over a crashed UFO.
     ~ Learn if there is a way to add a custom-made version for the Cydonian assault.

#####

+ Minor Changes:

 - Correctly place the new lore for Alien Alloy, now called Xenominium, Xenium Alloy short, and Xelloy in slang.
   * Consists of high-entropy alloys of known and other alien elements.
   * The real problem is not knowing the elements but the proportion for the correct mix to obtain desired properties.
 - Clean every .rul file from unused lines, reorder and correct all annotations.
   * "#----- topic -----#" should be the correct format.
   * Eliminate all that have an excess of dashes.
   * Check all the "ojito" notifications.

#####

+ Major Changes:
 - include xcom npcs in base defenses
 - (new, in actual patch  ) Reduce numbers of NCP needed by xcom
   * perhaps reduce the engineers by a third
     ~ this then needs to be translated in tweaks to projects and buildings balance
   * maybe one fith of the scientist
     ~ researches, salaries, living and labs balances should be taken into consideration.   
 - Implement daytime and nighttime camouflage.
   * Balance total vision and ranges.
 - Tanks, UFOs, and Sectopods use pilots.
   * Create a new soldier transformation to train them; they will now be armor instead of units.
   * Training requires overcoming claustrophobia, thus requiring a minimum bravery.
     ~ All tanks will be single-seaters, but the pilot cannot exit quickly, so with permanent destruction, the pilot dies.
     ~ The lore will be that once the tank is assembled, special facilities are needed to remove it and extract the pilot safely.
     ~ Create a special building to help with vehicle maintenance.
   * Integrate Sectopods with human pilots; they will be brown like in vanilla for human homogeneity.
   * When "destroyed," a "ruined chassis that can be repaired" remains.
 - Change all drones to a system based on "a CPU platform that can be inserted into different chassis and with different equipment."
   * The ground drone would be a platform to which various weapons could be attached, e.g., a version with rockets, a version with a support machine gun, one with a shotgun for entry.
   * Or make it a project to change "weapons within the chassis" that requires space in the workshop and engineers.
   * Additionally, they would have different "armors."
     ~ A light chassis, many TUs but low resistance.
     ~ Reinforced, heavier and stronger but with fewer TUs.
     ~ Versions with xelloys, first basic and then advanced.
   * These changes would provide much more longevity to the use of drones by XCOM.
 - Add inventory sprites for civilians and a variety of civilians as well (possibly from XFILES).
 - Clearly add the recommendation for the song mod.
 - Implement a possible Armor chipping and degradation system.
 - Check all reloading TUs for every weapon.
   * Modify reload times, balance transfer times of items from one pocket to another.
   * Make bullpups take longer to reload as a balancing method.
   * Find out how to modify weapon reload times.
   * It should be faster to draw your weapon from the holster than to reload the primary.
     ~ Use the commands tuLoad and tuUnload.
   * Remember to include this "you need to additionally pay the cost of moving the ammo from its current inventory slot into a hand slot! Consider that when balancing reload costs."
   * "Take into consideration that, since OXCE v6.2, the OXCE behavior is now turned off by default. It can be enabled using the extendedItemReloadCost setting."
 - Rebalance the weight of all objects for more intuitive values.
   * Would a total rebalancing of the soldiers' strength be needed to maintain coherent values?
 - Total change in the price of items and all projects.
   * To make the numbers more coherent, or at least, as a minimum, reduce the cost of all initial weapons to say that it is scientific notation and is actually divided by a hundreth
   * reducir cost en manufacture
   * reducir funding de paises

 - (NEW) Review the file Scang.DAT and check which maps should get their MCD file modified to improve the mapview.
 - Organize the chaotic situation I have regarding medical STR_ articles, establish a unique nomenclature.
   * Use "medikit" consistently in str_ references, strings, and images.
#####

+ Long Term Changes:

 - Add new types of missions similar to EU2012.
   * Landed UFO (already implemented).
   * Crashed UFO (already implemented).
   * Abductions (perhaps low-scale "terror missions" with a small number of civilians, around 5, maybe?).
   * Ships attacks (counting as abductions?, small crews of sailors, less than a dozen).
   * Bomb disposal (should be the early "terror missions," maybe one per two months, to spice mission variety).
   * Asset recovery (WIP).
   * Extraction/escort (if it's possible to code a VIP mission, this should be once/twice per month?).
   * Key recovery mission twice or thrice per year MAX (already implemented).
   * Terror sites (BIG CHUNGUS ATTACKS) on council funding members, should be giant maps, a big number of civilians (20 perhaps?) and military presence (partially implemented, should be moved at least until April or May as a sign of conflict escalation).
   * Ship line cruisers (same as above, maybe two dozen passengers?).
 - Improve the pacing of missions escalation entirely.
   * Delay terror in major cities by a couple of months.
   * Definitely correct the spawning in cruise ship and boat missions (these might be the first terrors, then remote places like bases/facilities, then major cities).
   * Avoid key missions appearing in nonsensical locations (Europe, for example).
 - Find out how to make dynamic global reports.
 - Add lore to the previous world, North Korea nuked (paint it red?), Cape of Good Hope nuked (also red?), Haiti, and the Netherlands?, Israel?
 - Create medical technologies to recover wounds for humans (create a medbay and a base with a medbay included?).
 - Improve buildings so that they can be upgraded by building on top.
   * Priority to defense systems.
 - Completely improve the air game, interception, patrols, etc.
 - Organize and overhaul alien deployments.
 - Adjust the position of the Russian peninsula above the Kuril Islands, finalize changes to the world map.
 - Change all references from "str_" to all items.
   * Focusing on chargers and weapons.
   * Eliminating those that do not exist and focusing them correctly on their new identity.
 - Each council country must have at least 4 cities on the map.
 - Later add ambient music to different maps.
 - Completely improve the sound database.
   * To all weapons, different effects, explosions, etc.
 - Completely improve explosion sprites (check XFILES and other mods).
   * Eliminate the cheesy effect of a skull as an explosion.
   * Create explosions of different colors according to the effect or damage caused.
   * Find out how to create an "implosion" effect that grows, then collapses and immediately expands again.
 - Implement elite alien weapons.
   * Confirm functionality of sprites.
   * Add a "whistling" sound bulletsound to scare tactics.
     ~ Check conversation with EfrenEspartano.
 - Convert all images to PNG.
   * This way, I can establish transparent alpha correctly.
 - Improve the entire ufopedia implementing this line of code of "removedBy" (https://openxcom.org/forum/index.php/topic,7639.msg0.html#new)
#####

+ Possible Unattainable Changes:

 - Create videos like in the PS1 assets.
 - Rearrange mission lists to something more coherent.
 - Add a "voices" system with dialogues for responses and more (not so sure about this, tho).
 - Check how the callsings of Vigilo Confido work (ask EfrenEspartano).
 - Pedirles a oxce que los loadouts sean algo definible en un RUL para q pase de partida a partida?

Posibles descripciones mutones:

Thrall:  this could be used to denote the non combatant crew, the lower caste/ranks of their hierarchy, the scum members of their race,not worthy enough to win the right to use an armor.

Grunt:  the more basic member of their army but they make the bulk of their ranks,the meat cannon, strong enough to hold a weapon, but no so intelligent to notice they are expendables.

Gladiator/Centurion(brute?)**:  the backbone of the sebilian invaders, they are the TRUE warrior caste, sebillians who proved to fullfill this role, they are though and good in their work, that being killing or dying for the hierarchy.
 

Chieftain: they live, they die and then live again, once gladiator/centurions lived enough to became veterans of a dozen fight, they achieve the honor to become chieftain and lead a warclan of their own
 

Warchief:  they are veterans of a hundred battles at least, only few sebilians show enough initiative , cunning skill and sharp intelligence to become warchief, they lead all the clans(and chieftains) to battle. They are in charge or leading the troops and accomplish the objectives of the campaings...they only answer to the warlord.
 

Champion:  true veterans, the elite of the elite,they are hundreds years old and have the same amount of battles, they participed in many succesfull campaings, many worlds invaded by the wraps of their actions, they are the personal bodyguards of the Warlord, and are the only one with the honor to have full battle armors, they are immensely though, taller, smarter that the average sebillian, the true parangon of a warrior race, beyond any of its quality, they possess the more dangerous of them, a fierce almos fanatic loyalty and devotion to their master, who they guard with extreme zealotry until they last breath.
 

Warlord:    the only and true leader of the seb-folk ,one only the most though,strogest and intelligent being inside their ranks can achieve this tittle and most important , hold it enough time to get the respect of all the warriors of the chain, once they proved themself with many victories, all the sebilian structures get the same goal, achieve the Warlord desires for plunder and conquest.
